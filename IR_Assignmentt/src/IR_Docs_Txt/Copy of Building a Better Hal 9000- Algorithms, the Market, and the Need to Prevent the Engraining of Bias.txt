THE ENGRAINING OF BIAS

ABSTRACT-As sci-fi fans will recall, the movie 2001: A Space

Odyssey is focused on the interaction between humans and artificial
intelligence. In the movie, HAL (Heuristically programmed Algorithmic
Computer) 9000 computer is an artificial intelligence and the onboard
computer on the spaceship Discovery 1. HAL 9000, more commonly called
"Hal," is capable of many functions, such as speech, facial recognition, lip
reading, interpreting emotions, and expressing emotions. HAL is built into
the Discovery 1 spacecraft, and is in charge of maintaining all mechanical
and life support systems on board. As the movie progresses, the astronauts
become concerned about HAL's behavior and agree to disconnect him, in
essence killing HAL. HAL becomes aware of the plan and seeks to stop his
death as the movie plot climaxes in a conflict between intelligent machine
and his human controllers. Interestingly, 2001: A Space Odyssey author
Arthur C. Clark could not have been more accurate about one of the
emerging conflicts to face humanity: what role does society want machines
to play in coordinating and governing human activity? The debate resonates
from the shared economy to the ethics of artificial intelligence. This article
seeks to advance the debate about the need for data regulation that focuses
on the impact of the use of the data. First, it provides a brief explanation of
data analytics, algorithms, and machine learning. Second, the article explores
some of the common mistakes associated with data modeling within
algorithmic processes. Third, the paper explores the impact of the use of data,
specifically data that is used to create a digital personhood, to inform
algorithms that perform basic services. Fourth and finally, the article seeks

INTRODUCTION

The technologies of collection and analysis that fuel "Big Data" are
being used in nearly every sector of society and the economy;' in fact, data
collection in large parts of the developed world is nearly ubiquitous. 2

Unsurprisingly, much of the information gathered has to do with consumers
whose information is of high value to businesses seeking to gain and retain

customers through tailored advertising and services.3 As greater value is
recognized, more information is collected,4 and the cycle continues.
Many consider it a benefit that advertisements can be directed and
tailored to the individual instead of bulk mails and communications that clog
inboxes and mailboxes worldwide. And the use of algorithms combined
with advancing levels of automation has the potential to greatly reduce
human error and lessen bias and the negative impacts of emotion on human
decision making processes.6 For example, the University of California San
Francisco's Medical Center uses an algorithmically operated robot to run a
fully automated hospital pharmacy.' Forensic accounting and other financial
analysis techniques are also fully operational in assisting with the detection
of business manipulation of disclosed information, along with protection
from credit card fraud and identity theft.'
However, this new Big Data frontier is potentially rife with risk. For
example, while Facebook allows for distant friends to stay virtually close,
many entities are now using Facebook postings and communications as a
means to gather information. Consider U.K.-based car insurer Admiral,

which attempted to launch "Firstcarquote" as a means to analyze the
Facebook accounts of first-time car buyers to see whether their personalities
suggest they will be safe drivers 0 and, more significantly, to adjust their rates
accordingly. Fortunately, Facebook stepped in and stopped the practice.
Another example is the creation of a psychological analytics model described
by Michael Kranish in the Washington Post in which he reports on President
Donald Trump's plan to build a "psychographic" profile of every voter to
enable targeted campaigning." Finally, consider the Facebook controversy
surrounding the use of targeted advertising that seemingly allowed for
marketers to exclude users by "ethnic affinity." 1 2
The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is beginning to take notice
of the issues surrounding the widespread use of these technologies,
especially as it relates to bias. According to James Zou, Assistant Professor
for Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University, "machine systems are
learning human biases." 3 For example, Princeton University researchers
conducted a word association task with a popular unsupervised Al algorithm
that uses online text to understand human language.14 After training the Al
through basic word associations taught by the researchers, the algorithm was
then asked to create its own associations. During this unsupervised phase the
Al linked white-sounding names with "pleasant" and black-sounding names
with "unpleasant."" And these are just a few of the more recent experiences
of difficulties and warnings emerging from the development and deployment
of Al into our daily lives.
Perhaps the most significant stakes lie in how Big Data and Al become
implicit in regulating access to basic civil and human rights. As a 2014 White

House Report entitled Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values
notes:
It is one thing for Big Data to segment consumers for marketing purposes,
thereby providing more tailored opportunities to purchase goods and services.
It is another, arguably far more serious, matter if this information comes to
figure in decisions about a consumer's eligibility for-or the conditions for the
provision of-employment, housing, health care, credit, or education.16
This Report highlights five areas of discriminatory impacts, each
illustrated by well-known stories of information gathering that resulted in
negative outcomes for individuals. For example, Facebook information
gathering as a pre-employment screening tool appears in numerous news
stories, so much so that several state legislatures have sought to limit
mandatory disclosure of social website passwords." Yet, while the White
House Report makes the distinction between tailoring services and practicing
unethical discrimination, what it leaves unclear is just how subtle, yet
powerful, the unintended harms of Big Data use can be. Understanding the
risks inherent in even well-intentioned uses of Big Data and machine
learning, and thus crafting effective legal and policy responses, involves
managers and policymakers having a critical understanding of how machine
learning actually works.
In 2011 Professors Bostrom and Yudkowsky in their book Cambridge
Handbook ofArtificial Intelligence asked readers to:
Imagine, in the near future, a bank using a machine learning algorithm to
recommend mortgage applications for approval. A rejected applicant brings a
lawsuit against the bank, alleging that the algorithm is discriminating racially

against mortgage applicants. The bank replies that this is impossible, since the
algorithm is deliberately blinded to the race of the applicants."1

They go on to add: "Statistics show that the bank's approval rate for
black applicants has been steadily dropping. Submitting ten apparently
equally qualified genuine applicants (as determined by a separate panel of
human judges) shows that the algorithm accepts white applicants and rejects
black applicants.""
They ask: "What could possibly be happening?"2 0 This scenario goes
straight to the key ethical impacts outlined by the White House:
discrimination in credit access is a fundamental pillar of institutional racism.
Professors Bostrom and Yudkowsky use this example to highlight an often
misunderstood aspect of machine learning and artificial intelligence
algorithms; addressing biased outcomes is not as simple as blaming the
programmer.

This article seeks to enter into the debate surrounding the need for data
regulation, however, it advances the argument that any regulation of data
needs to begin to encompass considerations of the use of the data and the
corresponding impacts of such use. The article is structured as follows: first,
it provides a brief explanation of data analytics, algorithms, and machine
learning; second, the article explores some of the common mistakes
associated with data modeling within algorithmic processes; third, the study
explores the impact of the use of data, specifically data that is used to create
a digital personhood, to inform algorithms that perform basic services; fourth
and finally, the article seeks to define an ethical decision-making model and
regulatory structure for data, leveraging the literature on polycentric
governance and focusing on the impact of data usage upon both the
individual and society.

ALGORITHMS, ANALYTICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING

This section provides a brief overview of algorithms and machine
learning in particular to provide a foundation for discussion. At its most
basic, it is important to note the distinctions between Big Data, data mining,
and machine learning. Big Data is a fairly nebulous term for enormously
large data sets that have only recently become possible to accumulate; by
extension, it is often used colloquially to refer to the computing processes
applied to those data sets and the insights thereby derived. But such

processes are not identical. Data mining, specifically, discovers previously
unknown patterns and knowledge within Big Data sets. Machine learning,
by contrast, is used to analyze patterns and then apply results to decision
making and actions.2 1 All computing processes, from mining to learning, in
some sense rely on algorithms, but their scope, complexity, and conceptual
accessibility varies widely.2 2
Many of the algorithms that have shaped our world so far, such as
Google's PageRank and Amazon's recommendations feature, perform
functions that could have previously been done with paper and pencil (and a
lot of hard work). Their key contribution is that they help to order and arrange
vast volumes of data at a scale and speed impossible for human beings,
making increasingly large data sets "legible," and making the end user's
interactive experience seamless and non-intrusive. When it comes to
machine learning, however, there is a truly new element; machine learning
can not only produce outputs that would not have been possible with earlier
technologies, but can also be incorporated into human institutional processes
in such a way that key decisions are in some sense made in the "black box"
of the algorithm itself Moreover, contrary to the common impression that if
an algorithm gives a bad answer, it must be that the programmer set it up to
return bad answers, it is not always so easy to deconstruct how specific
outputs are produced-hence the black box. This is why any discussion of
law and ethics involving machine learning must first attempt to understand
the basic technical premises, and equally important, map out how machine
learning and other non-algorithmic institutional actors interact to produce
legally and ethically relevant decisions.
In general, the SAS Institute notes the two most widely adopted
methods of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning:
Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an
input where the desired output is known. For example, a piece of equipment
could have data points labeled either 'F" (failed) or "R" (runs). The learning
algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs,
and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to
find errors. It then modifies the model accordingly. Through methods like
classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting, supervised learning

uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data. 23

NORTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Supervised learning accounts for approximately seventy percent of
machine learning applications.2 4 "It is commonly used in applications where
historical data predicts likely future events.2 5 For example, it can anticipate
when credit card transactions are likely to be fraudulent or which insurance
customer is likely to file a claim." 2 6 In contrast: "Unsupervised learning is
used against data that has no historical labels. The system is not told the
'right answer.' The algorithm must figure out what is being shown. The goal
is to explore the data and find some structure within."2 7
The SAS Institute suggests that "[u]nsupervised learning works well on
transactional data.2 8 For example, it can identify segments of customers with
similar attributes who can then be treated similarly in marketing campaigns.2 9
Or it can find the main attributes that separate customer segments from each
other."30
Both forms of machine learning have their strengths. Both are
vulnerable to the oft-repeated GIGO principle: "garbage in, garbage out." If
your data collection is limited or conceptually flawed, the conclusions the
machine will spit out will be limited and flawed.3 1 In the next section, we
will explore some of the more subtle but potent possible problematics in
machine-learning-assisted decision-making.
II. INVISIBLE BIAS AND THE MECHANISMS OF REPRODUCTION
The widespread use of algorithms has created a vast landscape of stored
and networked data, and because the value of any one piece of data is not
easily delimited, but rather includes the potential to yield further data through
algorithmic learning processes, data on all of us is also stored and mined in
ways that are frequently obscure.3 2 The hidden nature of this algorithmic data

environment is potentially troubling and not only in terms of transparency.
These are data sets in which many discrete pieces of information, together
with pattern analyses made possible by algorithms, can be pieced together to
complete a very accurate "virtual person." According to noted authority Eric
Siegel: "[1]t is the generation of new data that can lead to the indirect
discovery of unvolunteered truths about people." 3 3 Yet a third troubling
feature of this environment is that societal assumptions based on automation
bias can transform the reasonably good predictions of machine learning into
accepted "truths."3 4 And the manner in which these truths are created-about
each of us-at the intersection of Big Data and the human social systems that
utilize it, must draw the attention of ethicists and academics, lest automation
bias lead us to overlook the many ways misuse, both opportunistic and naive,
can invade our daily lives.
This section explores the manner in which some of the most common
pernicious impacts of invisible biases and misperceptions become engrained
in algorithmic processes, with potentially devastating consequences. First,
we discuss the effect of the Big Data black box on social science, which is
leading many to question our ability to explore and discover potential bias in
a scientific manner. Next, we explore the effects of unrecognized recursion
in Big Data-driven decision-making processes, an issue we frame in terms
of barriers to overcoming problematic "common sense." Finally, we look at
how the existence of black box algorithms can lead to issues with "ethical
agency" causing problems related to accountability and responsibility for
decision making.
A.

The Misuse ofStatistics and Social Science

The scientific method has historically demanded adherence to a
fundamental set of standardized techniques for building scientific
knowledge. The use of the scientific method is the hallmark of social science
research, which provides crucial insights for policymakers, educators, and
law enforcement, among other groups. While certain details of an experiment
may be cloaked (for example, by de-identifying human subjects), to be
considered scientifically valid an experiment must be capable of
replication.3 5 The hidden, often proprietary nature of data sets and the
algorithms that work them has led to the growth of studies that are presented

with the authority of social science, but without reporting the detailed
methods necessary for scientific replication or robust critical examination.
In the world of Big Data, "social science" is frequently carried out without
the transparency that occurs when replication is the expected standard. As
noted author, Cathy O'Neil highlights in her book, Weapons of Math
Destruction: "Ill conceived mathematical models now micromanage the
economy, from advertising to prison.... They're opaque, unquestioned, and
unaccountable, and they operate at the scale to sort, target, or optimize
millions of people."36
Despite the use of pseudo-science, we allow it to guide decision-making
in some of the most fundamental aspects of our human existence.37 The
analytics industry38 frequently implies that true social science, based on the
scientific method and statistical analysis, is being used in the interpretations
of data sets and outcomes. Proprietary data sets and black-box algorithms,
however, mean that in many cases no one is able to independently verify that
basic statistical principles are being followed in predictive design,39 making
it difficult to distinguish reliable findings from pseudo-science. As
highlighted by Professor Shane Jensen, "I've read about many studies in
medicine, economics and social science that could benefit from more
discussion with statisticians about the analysis of collected data and the
collection of the data itself."4 0
This situation has exacerbated the comprehension gap between experts
and those using their findings, with the prestige of technology adding an aura
of objectivity to analyses of widely varying quality. It is true that machine
learning is a powerful tool; in particular, it is excellent at finding correlations.
The dilemma, as noted by Eric Siegel writing in PredictiveAnalytics, "is, as
it is often said, correlation does not imply causation. The discovery of a
predictive relationship between A and B does not mean that one causes the

38 Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. It is
often within the area of interpretation that the line begins to blur between social science and reasoned
guesses.

other, not even indirectly. No way, no how." 4 1 Making this point in a
humorous manner, Professor David Leinweber 4 2 found questionable
correlations amongst financial indicators, 43 and used this contrived analysis
to form an elaborate publicity stunt in which he stated the "best predictor of
the S&P 500's performance" is the production of butter in Bangladesh.4 4 The
global financial crisis put predictive analytics to the test; a test that, some
argue, was an abject failure due to incorrect assumptions that existed within
the system. 4 5 As New York Times author Saul Hansell explains: "Financial
firms chose to program their risk-management systems with overly
optimistic assumptions. . . . Wall Street executives had lots of incentives to
make sure their risk systems didn't see much risk at all." 46 Yet, of the many
financial analysts who use simulated investment results as a means to test
investment performance, it seems that few fully appreciate how the logic
underlying these simulations has frequently been problematic.
This absence of the adherence to the scientific method as a cornerstone
within digital social science potentially removes legally and professionally
created procedures and protections that have long protected the ethical
integrity of the field and been considered hallmarks of the profession. For
example, consider the Facebook research scandal in which Facebook
manipulated nearly 700,000 users' news feeds to see whether it would affect
their emotions. 47 Critics and ethicists argued that the absence of informed
consent-considered an expectation within the social science research
community-was ignored within this experimental design. 48 According to
one of the researchers, Adam Kramer, this type of social science should be

allowed "because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the
people that use our product." 49 The statement demonstrates a common
concern of "online social science," which is that there are often an inadequate
number of academically trained traditional social scientists involved. More
collaboration between academics and industry would help promote informed
consent."o However, as noted by Wharton researchers Ric Bradlow, Shane
Jensen, Justin Wolfers, and Adi Wyner, when it comes to "statisticians-forhire," there is a tendency to choose comparison groups that support their
clients."
When unevaluated, questionably unethical (or at least lacking true
consent) pseudo social science is allowed to be relied upon in the same
manner as true social science, regulators must begin to consider the impact
of outcomes on society as a whole.
B. Engrainingof "Common Sense"
Common sense and common knowledge often run hand in hand and
neither has a universal definition that transcends generations or ethical
debate. Despite the lack of clear definition, one thing is certain-regardless
of the different shades of meaning, the use of the term "common sense"
implies education and wisdom. Yet, within that shading is an understanding
that common sense is shared by-or "common to" -nearly all people
without any need for debate.52 One then must wonder if we should be content
with common sense being captured and memorialized within an algorithm.
Consider gendered advertising. The color pink has been associated with girls
for barely a hundred years,53 yet at this point in time the association is so
powerful that it has entered common sense that a pink product is a product
for women, something many consumers in the West know and reflect in their
behavior, regardless of how they actually feel.54 There are many criticisms
that can be made of such crude readings of gender, including that such
conventions may serve to limit market creativity by replacing actual

experimentation, research, and innovative development with a dependable
and predictable women's "market" created more or less by fiat. What are
we to do with this type of common sense that should no longer be viewed as
common sense? One of the positive potentials of Big Data in advertising is
the ability to actually get beyond these limiting and biased models to better
identify and better serve diverse populations. However, unrecognized
recursion poses a challenge to fully unlocking this potential.
To understand the challenge, consider the popular game, the Tower of
Hanoi. This traditionally wooden puzzle consists of three rods, and a number
of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with
the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest
at the top. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another
rod while obeying a set of simple rules while learning basic problem-solving
skills. As many players figure out, there is a pattern that, if repeated, will
result in the objective being achieved. As such, the Tower of Hanoi may be
considered a popular way to teach recursive algorithms to a beginning
programming student. Recursion in computer science is a method in which
the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the
same problem. 56 This method makes larger, often multistep problems more
manageable and capable of compounding solutions. However, by the same
token, when a mistake is included in a recursive process, its repetition leads
to compounded problems.
We argue that when machine learning is included in a decision-making
process that also includes institutional and human actors, we can analyze that
entire process as a learning system: the feedback of information from data
through algorithmic processing into information outputs interpreted by
human/institutional actors, into social impacts, and back into data again.
Zooming out from the machine-learning component to view the overall
learning system, we can analyze ways it is susceptible to both the benefits
and risks of unrecognized recursion.
Perhaps no case illustrates these dangers more than predictive policing.
High-tech policing is no longer the storyline in a movie; it is a reality in many
communities such as New York, Houston, Seattle, and Fresno.5 ' And the

level of data gathering and analytics, even prediction, may surprise some.
For example, in the Real Time Crime Center in Fresno the software
application known as Beware, scours "billions of data points, including arrest
reports, property records, commercial databases, deep Web searches" as well
as a citizen's "social-media postings."" These data points are then used to
calculate a threat level that is fed back to the officers to be used in their
decision-making process, often in real time volatile situation." Many
communities have particular aspects of high-tech policing. While the most
common forms of surveillance are cameras and automated license plate
readers, the use of handheld biometric scanners, social media monitoring
software, devices that collect cellphone data, and drones are all being used
as surveillance tools.60 And all of this data is fed into larger databases that
expand the information available to governments. For example, the FBI's
Next Generation Identification (NGI) project collects fingerprints, iris scans,
data from facial recognition software, and other sources that aid local
departments in identifying suspects.61
There certainly is room for improved policing, but these scenarios are
cause for concern. The Ford Foundation's Michael Brennan lays out the
problem:
I recently attended a meeting about some preliminary research on 'predictive
policing,' which uses these machine learning algorithms to allocate police
resources to likely crime hotspots. The researchers at the Human Rights Data
Analysis Group discussed how these systems are often deployed in response to
complaints about racial bias in policing, but the data used to train the algorithm
62
comes from the outcomes of the biased police activity.
As we've seen with earlier examples, here, the outcomes of machine
learning may be illuminating, but it is crucial to keep in mind that the
machine got its information from us. Therefore ethically relevant data
corruption originates long before the machine learning program is written.
The data fed in, even if uncorrupted from a data science point of view, is
itself a record of human bias. For vendors and policymakers, Big Data is an
exercise in finding legitimate insight in the echo chamber. For individuals,

both as consumers and citizens, the line between accessing information and
submitting to conditioning becomes ever thinner. If you have ever used
someone else's computer without ad blocking, you have seen how, despite
increasing ad sophistication, there remains an intense blunt force effect from
bots getting one or two simple pieces of data, and shaping the world that you
experience.
Brennan goes on to unpack the implications of predictive policing in
chilling terms:
If the police are stop-and-frisking brown people, then all the weapons and drugs
they find will come from brown people. Feed that to an algorithm and ask it
where the police should concentrate their energies, and it will dispatch those
cops to the same neighborhoods where they've always focused their energy, but
this time with a computer-generated racist facewash that lets them argue that
they're free from bias.63
Thus, the second important point is that we are now learningfrom the
machines. This is where problems like the already discussed issue of
imagined objectivity, and our next topic of concern, elided agency, come into
play.
C. ElidedAgency
One of the common issues that arise when discussing invisible biases
that become engrained in algorithmic processes arises from the
unwillingness of individuals or institutions to acknowledge the existence of
bias due to the 'it was the algorithm' justification. This issue often arises
because our notions of accountability and responsibility are susceptible to
blur when decisions come to be made by algorithms. The case that has
brought this issue to the forefront of public attention is the much-discussed
self-driving vehicle.6 4 If a self-driving vehicle finds itself in a situation where
there is no course of action that will not cause harm to human life-for
example, it can hit a child on the road or swerve off the edge of the cliff,
risking the driver's life - how do we apply concepts of manslaughter and
murder? Various discussions have considered how to apportion liability
among the driver, the programmers (a large group), the manufacturer, and
the software proprietor.6 5 One aspect of this problem that these discussions

do not always cover is the issue of ability and responsibility: algorithms have
capacities that differ from humans. A human driver in this situation does not
actually have time to make a decision, but reacts on reflex, and a human
driver may be guilty of taking various risks that contribute to an accident,
such as driving while impaired.6 6 There are many cases in which a selfdriving car has the capacity to perceive and enact a course of action that a
human brain would not be able to compute; on the flip side, they can be
highly predictable in ways humans cannot-it is safe to assume that neither
speeding nor texting contributed to an accident by a self-driving car, for
example.6 7 In other words, the considerations that bear on the difference
between murder and manslaughter may not be the same for a learning
machine as for a human. Of course, cars do not have agency in the sense of
consciousness. Nonetheless, to the extent that they are capable of making
determinations, including novel determinations that no programmer foresaw
or intended, we may need to adjust our notions of ethical responsibility.
The ethical and liability questions of self-driving vehicles are already
widely recognized. What deserves more attention are processes in which
machine decision-makers are either replacing human decision-makers, or
introducing entirely new decision points into a human process, without it
being realized by those affected. In such cases, there is a danger of elided
agency-outcomes that once were someone's responsibility can appear
inevitable or fade into background conditions when in fact, there is a legally
and/or ethically relevant juncture, with no ethically relevant human actor in
it-because a machine was the relevant decision-maker.
For example, although the traditional concept of censorship implies
conscious, ideological agency, unconscious automated filters can produce
results that look very much like censorship. Many commentators argue that
algorithm censorship is growing at an alarming rate-and yet many citizens
remain unaware of its existence. Consider the simple, yet common, example

of the blocking of the livestream of the 2012 Democratic National
Convention.68 On September 4, 2012, the DNC posted on YouTube, an
official streaming partner, several videos of speeches and other highlights of
the DNC's evening events, all of which were featured prominently on
BarackObama.com and the YouTube channel DemConvention2012. Some
portion of the DNC videos triggered the YouTube digital fingerprinting
system and, as a result, YouTube put a copyright blocking message on the
livestream video.69 Even more concerning in this instance are the multiple
parties that claimed copyright infringement,70 and the ability of a single
(alleged) copyright holder to shut down a live stream of a publicly important
event." The blocking is demonstrative of the limitations of algorithms in
some key areas; as Wired magazine author Andy Baio explains: "The
inability to understand context and parody regularly leads to 'fair use' videos
getting blocked, muted or monetized." 7 2 Moreover, as technology expert
Parker Higgins notes: "It's impossibly complicated to define in a set of
'business rules' for automated [copyright] enforcement." 73
Although in this paper we are focusing on danger zones, it is important
to note at this juncture that the use of algorithms can be highly positive.
Machine learning can offer a means to uncover and overcome existing, often
hidden, biases, enhance human/institutional decision-making, and reduce
error in areas of human agency. For example, a recent paper from the
National Bureau of Economic Research comes to the conclusion that

makes managers' hiring decisions worse." 7 4 To make this determination, the
researchers introduced a series of job tests in the hiring process. 5 However,
the managers were allowed to either use or override the testing program's
suggestions.7 6 According to the study, when managers used their discretion
to override the hiring order implied by the test results, the outcomes, in terms
of both tenure and productivity, were worse.
In this case, because the human managers still take the final action with
the advisement of the algorithm, they clearly assume responsibility, ethically
and legally, for that action. However, increasingly, automated programs are
removing human actors from the decision-making process entirely, raising
knottier questions.
In summary, we can conclude that the use of Big Data and machine
learning technologies offers amazing opportunities to supplement and
surpass human decision-making, but also poses a risk of reinforcing preexisting problems through recursive learning between humans and machines.
Invoking words like "data" and "algorithm" can provide a veneer of
objectivity and social science that prevents the critical discussion and
iterative improvement necessary to actually use them wisely. Thus, far from
being a shortcut, this technology demands that police, programmers,
policymakers, and citizens bring a high level of social, historical, and
statistical literacy to interpreting these data responsibly.

It is difficult to argue against the assertion made by Guardian writer
Leo Hickman that "algorithms rule the world."" Algorithms can be a force

section, we lay out some of the major areas of concern for policymakers
trying to guide the ways in which these tools are used.
A.

Barriersto Economic Development and Basic Life Services

One of our major areas of concern with algorithmic processes are biases
that reinforce existing social discrimination. For example, we know that
institutional racism enacted in law and policy by local governments, big
banks, and big business-not merely by individuals exercising their
individual racist preferences-has already created areas of low service,
limited capital, cyclical debt, and population disruption within cities." We
have already seen several examples of how machine learning can "pick up"
racism and sexism. 8 2 The consequences can be dire if the machine learning
is feeding into systems like housing, healthcare, market access, and transit.
Several new uses of Big Data promise to tie credit ratings-already a
rigged system-into even more discriminatory barriers. According to a
recent story by Forbes,8 3 credit rating agencies may soon be harvesting data
on word usage on social media to adjust credit scores. And other reports
suggest that lenders are looking at social networks themselves 84 -i.e., who
you know-which would be an enormous disadvantage for people from lowcredit communities, even if their individual credit-worthiness is high.
In the area of economic disadvantage and new technology, we see a lot
of old wolves in new sheepskins. For example, even as Uber is challenged
on its status as an employer, 5 one commenter argues that status needs to be
regulated in the interest of consumers, to ensure equal access to the
transportation services:
Currently, Uber and Lyft are killing cabs because [they] are cheaper and
cooler. Part of the reason [they're] cheaper is because [they] aren't taxed and
regulated as highly. Part of the reason you're cooler is because Lyft and Uber

drivers are generally English-speaking, friendly, helpful young men and
women. I see the appeal, but since you are currently free to not serve my
neighborhood, it means that the taxis that you are killing are my only option
and I'm watching it wither away. . . . Why are so many otherwise thoughtful
decent people swinging on the Uber and Lyft bandwagons when they are, in
essence, facilitating a return to institutional racism by choosing a service that
is specifically not obligated by the protections we as a society agreed many
8 6
years ago were necessary in order to preserve equal access?

While new business models raise the question of new regulation
discussed further in Part IV, in the case of sharing economy apps that claim
to be "transparent" and "empowering" it can be all too easy to overlook old
problems, like redlining, in new guises.
B.

Power Differentials & Economic Incentives in the Information
Marketplace

As noted authority Frank Pasquale writes in his The Black Box Society,
"Knowledge is power. To scrutinize others while avoiding scrutiny oneself
is one of the most important forms of power."" In an economy where data is

exponentially valuable, but only large institutions have the means to mine
that value, individuals are increasingly incentivized to give away large
amounts of their personal data.
While many such instances of this incentivization may be quite
reasonable and benign, the use of leverage to obtain profitable data occurs in
areas where broader considerations of justice may apply, such as basic life
services. Consider John Hancock Insurance, which announced in April 2015
that it would partner with Vitality to encourage a healthier lifestyle and offer
insurance discounts for those committed to a healthy lifestyle." However, as
noted cybersecurity scholar Evgeny Morozov noted: "Unlike the rich, who
pay for their connectivity with their cash, the poor pay for it with their
data." 9
A story in PC World offers a similar example from another sector of
basic services; lending.

Hong Kong-based micro-lender Lenddo - which asks for your Facebook,
Twitter, Gmail, Yahoo, and Windows Live logons when you sign up -- reserves
the right to rat you out to all your friends. Per Lenddo's FAQ: As long as you
don't fall behind on any Lenddo loan installments, you have complete control
over your privacy settings and your information will only be shared with your
permission. IF YOU FAIL TO REPAY, Lenddo MAINTAINS THE RIGHT
TO NOTIFY YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY."

The market for micro-loans is focused on the economically
disadvantaged. This is a case of an explicit tradeoff: less privacy for access
to credit that is otherwise unavailable.
A frequent refrain in discussions of online data use and privacy is that
consumers "choose" to give up their data in return for service and
convenience." One criticism is that many consumers are not sufficiently tech
literate to realize how much they are giving away. But equally important,
data is the price of admission for many basic services. While you might
choose not to have a Facebook page, when everyone from employers to pizza
delivery places demand your demographic data, it is an enormous logistical
and psychological challenge to find a way to say no while still accessing
basic services. There is limited ethnographic evidence that certain literate
consumer groups do make choices about whether to use specific services
based on whether they feel they are getting equivalent value for their
personal data.9 2 Yet at the end of the day, even the most literate and attentive
consumers would have a hard time keeping up with constant unilateral end
user license agreement updates on the software that powers their lives.9 3
In many ways, there is no more concerning area of knowledge and
power dissymmetry than in the health care field. The urge to apply insights
from Big Data and Machine Learning can complicate existing inequities in
access to medical care and personal choice-a hot topic in Big Data circles. 9 4
Big Data used correctly may improve our ability to prevent epidemics and
simultaneously enhance individual outcomes through personalized
medicine. For example, Stanford researchers are working on the creation of

an algorithm that identifies individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia,
which is a disorder that drastically increases the likelihood of suffering a
heart-related incident, yet is often hidden.9 6 Unfortunately, the cluster of
behaviors and symptoms that underlie this disease tend to be difficult to
identify, prior to a heart related incident." Thus, the Stanford researchers
hope to create an algorithm that allows for early detection.
However, who has the responsibility, or the right, to use these data to
improve health outcomes is a major question. For example, Castlight Health,
a third party health care management app for employees, gathers user
information from various sources, including medical information reported
by individuals in the medical management system, and reports the
information back to employers." According to the Wall Street Journal:
"[A]fter finding that 30% of employees who got second opinions from toprated medical centers ended up forgoing spinal surgery, Wal-Mart tapped
Castlight to identify and communicate with workers suffering from back
pain." 00 Jonathan Rende, Castlight's chief research and development officer
stated: "Castlight then contacted employees whose insurance and drug
claims included back problems, painkillers and spinal injections with advice
for physical therapists or second opinions."o This attempt to nudge

on the employer and insurer for access to healthcare, to make medical
decisions they never intended, raises questions of where the line lies between
caring and interfering.
C. Influencing the Information Received
Issues of censorship-couched in intellectual property rights-also
exist within the realm of search engines.103 For example, in January 2012, the
British Recorded Music Industry (BPI), Motion Pictures Association (MPA),
Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT), the Premier League,
and the Publishers Association proposed an "Anti-Piracy Code of Practice
for Search Engines." 1 0 4 The proposed code requires search engines to demote
sites in their rankings for repeatedly making available pirated content. To
facilitate such a change, search engines would be expected to promote within
their rankings "licensed" or "certified" websites.1 0 5 Search engines would
also agree to stop promoting pirate websites, to not place ads on those sites,
and refrain from selling keyword advertising related to piracy terminology.10 6
In addition to protecting intellectual property rights, potentially at the risk of
censoring some kinds of information altogether, algorithms are also daily
tailoring what each of us sees on the internet, to the point that users have
increasingly fewer points of common reference, and some users may be
effectively censored from ever accessing certain types of content at all. Few
people are surprised to learn that Google alters your search results and
Amazon changes the products it shows you based on products you have
viewed and purchased.' Many consumers find this to be a benefit. Yet, they
might be surprised to learn that prices can also be tailored. 10
More troubling, the manner in which we receive news is controlled, in
many ways, by an algorithm.

Algorithms are basically everywhere in our news environment, whether it's
summarization,
personalization,
optimization,
ranking,
association,
classification, aggregation, or some other algorithmic information process.
Their ubiquity makes it worth reflecting on how these processes can all serve
to systematically manipulate the information we consume, whether that be
through embedded heuristics, the data fed into them, or the criteria used to help
them make inclusion, exclusion, and emphasizing decisions. 109

Fake newsfeed articles became a topic of discussion in the 2016
presidential election.o As President Obama argued: "People, if they just
repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's
on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people
start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense." 1 1 It is not as if
the generators of fake-news stories had social science in mind; instead they
elected to use social science to an unethical end, justified by economic
incentives. As The Washington Post reported, Paul Homer makes $10,000 a
month off of ads on his pro-Trump fake-news stories. As he explained: "My
sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time . .. I think Trump is
in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check
anything-they'll post everything, believe anything." 1 2
Unfortunately, Mr. Homer's surprise is unsurprising to many; social
scientists have been examining the role of social media role in creating
bubbles of influence for some time. In fact, previous research even explored
the potential impact of social media on political developments. In 2014,
Cornell Computational Communication Lab researchers noted "that media
events not only generate large volumes of tweets, but they are also associated
with (1) substantial declines in interpersonal communication, (2) more
highly concentrated attention by replying to and retweeting particular users,
and (3) elite users predominantly benefiting from this attention."1 3 Using
"eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, they
examined "how patterns of social media use change during these media

events." 1 4 Thus, the impact of social media on political events is well within
the current considerations of researchers. Further research is needed to
determine how to develop resiliency in the face of misinformation.
D. Surveillance Based Influence andManipulation
Facebook has been involved with several experiments that have caused
heated debate within the social science world each because of Facebook
altering feeds or information to influence individuals' behaviors. For
example, in 2010, Facebook experimenters assigned Facebook users into
three categories during the election. One group received a simple
information message about the election, one group received no information
at all, and one group received information and were given the ability to click
an 'I voted' button.115 The results showed that those who got the
informational message voted at the same rate as those who saw no message
at all.116 But those who saw the social message were 2% more likely to click
the 'I voted' button and 0.3% more likely to seek information about a polling
place than those who received the informational message, and 0.4% more
likely to head to the polls than either other group.' The researchers
estimated this resulted in about 340,000 extra people turning out to vote in
the 2010 U.S. congressional elections because of a single election-day
Facebook message.1
According to noted authority Professor Baldwin, "'Nudging' involves
structuring the choices that people make so as to lead them towards particular
outcomes." 1 9 Space constraints do not permit a full exploration of the theory
of "nudging,' but one particular type of nudge should draw our immediate
attention, the 'Third Degree Nudge,' which involves behavioral
manipulation that uses "a message with an emotional power that blocks the

119 Baldwin, supra note 102. There are actually three categories of nudges. 'First Degree Nudges,'
such as simple warnings or reminders, are designed to respect the decision-making autonomy of the
individual and serve no other purpose than to enhance the individual's reflective decision-making process.
A 'Second Degree Nudge' is designed to use 'choice architecture' to build on behavioral limitations in
an effort to bias a decision in the desired direction. See generally, RICHARD THALER & CASS SUNSTEIN,

consideration of all options." 20 Commentators argue that this type of
behavior manipulation directly impacts an individual's ability to act in
accordance with her or his own preferences.121 For example, according to
Sarah Buhr at Tech Crunch Apple maps has been directing people searching
for abortion clinics to adoption centers since 2011.122 This type of nudge is
not accidental, nor is it unnoticed. Yet, it persists even in the face of
confrontation by various groups. We must confront the reality that new
behavior patterns on socially significant scales may be driven by the
decisions of major marketers and service providers operating with no public
mandate.
IV. UNPACKING THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

This Part briefly unpacks the regulatory landscape focusing on the role
of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission before moving on to discuss global
developments in Big Data and data privacy. Subsequently, we pivot to
examine policy implications resulting from governance gaps. Due to the
fractured governance structure in play, we also rely on the field of
polycentric institutional analysis to give shape to both our analysis of the
regulatory status quo, and to lay out a path for policymakers going forward.
A. A PolycentricPrimer
The field of polycentric (multi-centered) governance is a multi-level,
multi-purpose, multi-functional, and multi-sectoral model1 23 that has been
championed by scholars, including Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom and
Professor Vincent Ostrom. It challenges orthodoxy by demonstrating the
benefits of self-organization, networking regulations "at multiple scales,"1 24
and examining the extent to which national and private control can in some
cases coexist with communal management. 125 The field also posits that, due

to the existence of free riders in a multipolar world, "a single governmental
unit" is often incapable of managing "global collective action problems"
such as cyber-attacks. 2 611nstead, a polycentric approach recognizes that
diverse organizations working at multiple levels can create different types of
policies that can increase levels of cooperation and compliance, enhancing
"flexibility across issues and adaptability over time." 27 Such an approach, in
other words, recognizes both the common but differentiated responsibilities
of public- and private-sector stakeholders and the potential for best practices
to be identified and spread organically, generating positive network effects
that could, in time, result in the emergence of a norm cascade toward greater
clarity in Big Data and privacy regulation. 128
The field of polycentric governance is far from a perfect fit as applied
to Big Data and Machine Learning, and the literature itself is incomplete, as
Professor Elinor Ostrom would have been the first to admit. 129 However, it
can provide insights about useful paths forward to generate norms within
fractured governance structures, and is, in fact, already the preferred path
forward from leading public- and private-sector stakeholders.130 This is
especially true when these findings are coupled with the wider literature on
regimes and institutional analysis, including its focus on property rights and
transaction costs, as is discussed further next in the context of applicable
federal and international law.131
B. The FederalTrade Commission
While many state and federal agencies may be implicated in bringing
actions against the activities described in Parts II and III, no agency is
arguably more central in the discussion than the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC). The FTC is a government agency that is responsible for protecting
the public against unfair business practices, including false and misleading

advertising.132 The agency has enforcement authority under its enabling
statute, the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act),133 which is a federal
consumer protection law that prohibits unfair or deceptive practices,
including offline and online privacy and data security policies.134 The FTC
has used this authority to, among other things, help define private-sector
cybersecurity best practices as an example of polycentric norm building
efforts,135 and is also the primary enforcer of the Self-Regulatory Principles
for Behavioral Advertising.136
To assist companies in managing online consumer based data gathering
and use, the FTC issued a report entitled "Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or
Exclusion."1 3 7 To "maximize the benefits [of Big Data] and limit the
harms "138 the FTC advises a company to consider the following questions:
*

*
*

How representative is your data set?139
Does your data model account for biases?140
How accurate are your predictions based on Big Data?141
Does your reliance on Big Data raise ethical or fairness concerns?142

With this guidance, the FTC seeks to enforce the FTC Act and to
encourage businesses to follow the law and principles described above. To
date, the FTC has brought many enforcement actions against companies
failing to comply with posted privacy policies and for the unauthorized
disclosure of personal data.143 FTC enforcement actions have been in the new

Firms operating multinationally, though, are making decisions on Big
Data and machine learning in reference to numerous legal regimes outside

have now adopted comprehensive data protection laws, including nearly
every country in Europe and many in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia,
and Africa. 150 It is, however, important to note that the U.S. has not adopted
a comprehensive information privacy law, instead opting for a sectorspecific approach. Examples of this style include the Health Insurance

* Data should be deleted when it is no longer needed for the stated
purpose
* Transmission of personal information to locations where "equivalent"
personal data protection cannot be assured is prohibited
* Some data is too sensitive to be collected, unless there are extreme
circumstances that justify such gathering (e.g., sexual orientation,
religion)
These agreed upon protections fail to fully envision the ease in which
data gathered, even publically available data, can be agglomerated into 'new'
data or data that when combined can create a complete picture of a digital
personhood. In addition, the protections fail to recognize that data collected
can be used in such a manner as to create significant impact on the individual
and society as a whole. It is these two unappreciated aspects of data
regulation that cause the greatest likelihood of discriminatory impacts, yet;
in many ways data regulation fails to anticipate such impacts.
D. Non-DiscriminationLegal Regulation
The right to non-discrimination is deeply embedded in the framework
that underlies both the United States and the European Union. For example,
in the European Union the right can be found in Article 21 of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 14 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, and in Articles 18-25 of the Treaty on the
154 See generally Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C.

(2000 & Supp

Functioning of the European Union, to name but a few. 1 56 In a similar
manner, the United States has attempted to reduce discrimination by crafting
policy. A simple example demonstrates the breadth of the regulation. Within
the area of employment, federal law protects individuals from discrimination
relating to: age, disability, equal pay/compensation, genetic information,
harassment, national origin, pregnancy, race/color, religion, retaliation, sex,
and sexual harassment, to name a few. 1 5 ' And while each of these areas place
people within a protected class, it is important to note that those individuals
that fall within a protected class vary based upon the federal law that is
implicated. The area is complex, murky, and often difficult to describe. For
the purposes of this article, what is most concerning, however, is the means
by which an individual demonstrates the existence of a discriminatory
practice. Returning to the employment example, in the United States, an
employee who believes they have been discriminated against based on their
status as a member of a protected class has several types of claims:
discriminatory intent/treatment disparate impact,1 58 and/or retaliation. 159And
while each of these categories is broad, the evidentiary rule is quite narrow
in the area of employment law. For example, to demonstrate the existence of
discrimination the employee must produce either direct evidence or
circumstantial evidence. And of course, direct evidence-that is, the
gathering of statements or other evidence that directly relates to
discriminatory practices-is very rare. Thus, employees are left with the
circumstantial route.
To demonstrate discriminatory practices, an employee that seeks to
demonstrate a Title VIll60 disparate treatment claim must satisfy the
156 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union art. 21, 2000 0.J. (C 364) 1; Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms art. 14, Nov. 4, 1950, E.T.S. No. 5, 213
U.N.T.S. 221; Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union art. 18-25,
2012 O.J. (C 326) 47.
157 See e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964: Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C.
§§ 1681-1688 (2012); Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6101-6107 (2012); Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2012).
158 A disparate impact claim is a type of discrimination based on the effect of an employment
policy,
rule, or practice rather than the intent behind it. See, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430
(1971) ("Under [Title VII], practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms
of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to 'freeze' the status quo of prior discriminatory
employment practices.").
159 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws prohibit retaliation and related conduct. See, e.g.,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2; Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 623; Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42
U.S.C. § 12112; Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act (Rehabilitation Act), 29 U.S.C. § 791; Equal Pay
Act (EPA), 29 U.S.C. § 215; Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 42
U.S.C. § 2000ff-i.
160 Title VII prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex
or national origin. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2.

McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting framework.16 1 Named for a famous
U.S. Supreme Court decision, an employee must be able to answer "yes" to
the following four questions:
*
*
*
*

Are you a member of a protected class?
Were you qualified for your position?
Did your employer take adverse action against you?
Were you replaced by a person who is not in your protected class
(or, in the case of age discrimination, someone substantially
younger than you)?

While these may seem to be simple straight forward questions, the
ability to demonstrate discrimination in these settings has proven very
difficult.1 6 2 Thus, the framework shifts the burden of production to the
employer to "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the
employee's rejection." 6 3 It is important to note, employment law within the
U.S. has developed a mechanism to handle situations in which it would be
difficult (or impossible) for an individual to gather the evidence necessary to
161 McDonnell Douglas v. Green 411 U.S. 792 (1973) and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.
Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). The other common test is the Price Waterhouse "mixed motive"
framework.
162 Of course, this is one example-in fact, the law recognizes that persons can be discriminated
against even if they were not replaced by someone outside of the protected class. Several authorities
within the area have suggested employees consider of the following criteria as well:
*
Were you treated differently than a similarly situated person who is not in your protected
class?
*
Did managers or supervisors regularly make rude or derogatory comments directed at your
protected class status or at all members of your class and related to work? For example,
"Women don't belong on a construction site" or "Older employees are set in their ways and
make terrible managers."
*
Are the circumstances of your treatment so unusual, egregious, unjust, or severe as to suggest
discrimination?
*
Does your employer have a history of showing bias toward persons in your protected class?
*
Are there noticeably few employees of your protected class at your workplace?
*
Have you noticed that other employees of your protected class seem to be singled out for
adverse treatment or are put in dead-end jobs?
*
Have you heard other employees in your protected class complain about discrimination,
particularly by the supervisor or manager who took the adverse action against you?
*
Are there statistics that show favoritism towards or bias against any group?
*
Did your employer violate well-established company policy in the way it treated you?
*
Did your employer retain less qualified, non-protected employees in the same job?

prove their claim. Such burden shifting is somewhat common in situations
where such difficulties arise. However, even an area of law that is
comfortable with information gathering difficulties will still be unable to
accommodate the difficulties created through the use of machine learning.
Remember, in a machine-learning decision-making world, even those well
versed in machine learning may be unable to roll back time and decipher
black box learning.
The inability to peer inside the black box is not a minor inconvenience,
and as can be seen within the area of employment law, even areas
accustomed to the black box dilemma will have difficulty handling such a
problem. Of course, employment is but one example, consider many of the
cases mentioned above-policing, insurance, credit worthiness. The
widespread use of machine learning will lead to black box based decision
making in many areas of our daily lives, with little to no mechanism of
examination or ability to demonstrate discrimination. Consider the case of
Google targeted ads mentioned above. As you may recall, Carnegie Mellon
researchers built a tool to simulate Google users that started with no search
history and then visited employment websites. 16 4 Later, on a third-party news
site, Google showed an ad for a career coaching service advertising
"$200k+" executive positions 1,852 times to men and 318 times to women. 16 5
While Google will not disclose the manner in which it targets ads,1 66 the
outcome is stark. Keep in mind, targeting ads is legal, discriminating on the
basis of gender is not. But, how is one to know which action is behind such
an outcome?
At least partially because of the inability to peer inside the box after a
machine learning based decision, the European Union has taken a more
regulatory approach when discussing machine learning. For example,
starting in 2018, EU citizens will be entitled to know how an EU institution
arrived at a conclusion-even if machine learning and a black box was
involved.16 7 As University of Oxford researcher Bryce Goodman explains,
the new data protection law entitled the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) is effectively a "right to an explanation" 6 8 for decisions. 169In fact,
the law does more; it also bans decisions "based solely on automated

processing, including profiling, which produces an adverse legal effect
concerning the data subject or 'significantly affects' him or her."170
Unfortunately, as can be seen from the cited language, the use of terms such
as 'solely' will leave large loopholes in the discussion about the use-or
requirements to use-human beings in the decision making processes.
Moreover, it is possible that an overly expansive reading of the language will
lead to a stifling of innovation in positive uses of machine learning. What is
clear, however, is that the attempted regulation demonstrates a recognition
of the growing ethical difficulties with black-box HAL-based decision
making.
E.

Implicationsfor Policymakers andManagers

In addition to the FCC recommendations (and others), it is time for
policymakers to think beyond privacy, specifically to impact; a point that the
European Union is considering as a linchpin of legal analysis. Like the EU,
we would like to suggest that U.S. regulation within this area must begin to
consider modern technology and thus begin to focus on the impact of the use
of information collected. The above examples highlight the need to begin to
consider polycentric interventions (including industry norms) that are
designed to contemplate the negative impacts created from the amalgamation
of large data sets, even if that information is all considered public
information or has been gathered with consent.
It is important to recognize one key point in the above suggestion-the
information being discussed in many of these examples is either public, or
information that has been gathered and used with consent. We argue that
consent should not be treated the same in the online environment.17 ' The
nature of disclosures, informed individuals, and consent has changed with
the ability of entities to push out large amounts of information and to obtain
consent with a mere click of the button; a button that often stands as the only
barrier before the consumer can obtain a coveted item. 172 The laws that apply
to consent must be reconsidered in light of the new research that
demonstrates that consumers are presented with too much information, often
in unmanageable formats with little desire or need to read or understand
terms. 173 Consent cannot cure this new world of disparate impact; neither can

transparency. 17 4 We have to begin to consider the impact of the use of
information and design regulation that is not overcome by a simple disclose
and a mere click.
Moreover, while issues of consent must be addressed, the resolution of
this issue does not eliminate-or even dent-the concerns that arise in
relation to "digital personhood." By digital personhood, we mean the profile
of each of us that is created through the use of public information."1 5 As
discussed above, we all share vast amounts of information; none of which is
protected under the current regulatory approaches to data protection and/or
privacy protections. What then must be immediately done to hold algorithms
accountable?
First, algorithms used within an area of potential discriminatory impact,
regardless of the source of the information being used, must be held to social
and statistical science accountability standards. This requires three things:
(1) accountability, (2) auditability, and (3) replication. The social science
profession has long subscribed to the ethics of applied social research, which
includes the principle of voluntary participation and informed consent.
Moreover, ethical standards require considerations of risk of harm, which
would include potential discriminatory impacts. Of course, each of these
principles demand a level of accountability for the designer and the user of
the information-with the power to adjust and respond to issues that arise.
And finally, the power of auditability-and replication-are essential
attributes with social sciences as it provides scientists the ability to monitor,
check and criticize both the design, the outcomes and the impact of the uses
of the information and outcomes.
Second, all decisions produced through a process that includes an
algorithm must be capable of explanation of outcome and the process that
occurred, including any decisions that were the product of a weighted
decision making process. It is important to understand not all attributes that
can appear at first blush as discriminatory actually have discriminatory
impacts. For example, being a black male increases your risk of inheriting
sickle cell anemia.176 Clearly these attributes built into some algorithms have
discriminatory impact, but in a medical diagnosis context, the impact must
be balanced against the medical needs of the individual and society's desire
to improve the health of its citizenry. Algorithms are taught to weigh certain

NORTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

attributes by the programmers and the learning process. These weightings,
attributes and other factors that impact the outcomes of the algorithm must
be capable of explanation and challenge, especially within areas of potential
discriminatory impact.
Third, all outcomes of an algorithm based process must be capable of
challenge by individuals and institutions. Mistakes occur even in machinebased decision making, from data entry mistakes to statistical errors.
Individuals impacted by algorithm based decision making need the ability to
challenge incorrect information and assumptions within the environment.
Allowing this type of correction is not merely important for the individuals,
but also allows those who design the algorithm to understand the nature of
the errors and correct for errors in the future.
The absence of U.S. law governing the amalgamation of information
and the unwavering belief that transparency is the answer to all that ails
online information gathering, leads us to argue that ethical considerations
must begin to be a larger part of the discussion surrounding the manner in
which information should be used and regulated.

V. AN

ETHICAL MODEL FOR EXAMINATION OF NEW DLEMMAS

While each of the above mentioned issues have probably given readers
more than a moment's pause, Silicon Valley is best known for pushing out
products and not for considering the societal or ethical considerations of the
use of their products."' Consider the case of the Internet of Things (JoT).
Many commentators," including two of this paper's authors,"' have called
for a greater emphasis to be placed on security within the JoT design
framework.8 0 Yet, it took an October 2016 attack in which "smart" home
devices were used as a major component in a DDoS attack to demonstrate
the true need of heightened built-in security on internet connected home
devices.18
Silicon Valley is in the business of delivering products that people want
to buy and use, it is a market based economy at its best. In fact, it seems that

those in the best position to consider and debate such an issue, those within
the group of the "data-driven oligarchy like Facebook, Google, Amazon, or
Uber" 18 2 wish to wash their hands of the real-world filter bubbles in which
"people become numbers, algorithms become the rules, and reality becomes
what the data says."183 In response, New Yorker author Om Malik notes:
Facebook's blunders are a reminder that it is time for the company to think not
just about fractional-attention addiction and growth but also to remember that
the growth affects real people, for good and bad. It is not just Facebook. It is
time for our industry to pause and take a moment to think: as technology finds
its way into our daily existence in new and previously unimagined ways, we
need to learn about those who are threatened by it. Empathy is not a buzzword
but something to be practiced.
With the absence of regulation and a widespread cultural attitude within
the design industry of ignoring the wider context of technology, how can we
ever begin to consider the larger ethical questions surrounding the use and
impact of technology in our lives? In Media Technologies,1 15 Tarleton
Gillespie outlines six "categories of ethical concern": (1) Patterns of
Inclusion (how data is selected for indexing); (2) Cycles of Anticipation (the
role of hypothetical models of consumer behavior in shaping algorithm
design); (3) Evaluation of Relevance (the sorting protocols of the algorithm
itself); (4) Promise of Objectivity (the often problematic rhetoric that
surrounds innovations in Big Data and Al); (5) Entanglement with Practice
(new technological phenomena considered within the full context of actual
implementation); (6) Production of Publics (basically a higher-level view of
how 2, 4, and 5 interact to create new human social groups). 186
To consider an example application of Gillespie's Model, let's return to
Bostrom and Yudkowsky's scenario of mortgages issued by a credit
worthiness algorithm."' The bank in the mortgage example may be
completely honest that it tried to institute a colorblind approval process. 8 ' In
this case, the problem lies in bias fossilized in the data set. The
overwhelming majority of the history of banking has been shaped by racist
discrimination, up to and through the 2008 housing market crash"' - and the

past is the source of the data set. If a supervised algorithm has been trained
on historical data, factors closely correlated with race are also likely to be
correlated with acceptance or denial, even if no explicit "race" data points
are included. As for an unsupervised algorithm, if it picked out and reapplied the pattern of discrimination on its own it would actually be doing
its job - as a pattern detector - exceedingly well.
As Bostrom and Yudkowsky explain:
If the machine learning algorithm is based on a complicated neural network, or
a genetic algorithm produced by directed evolution, then it may prove nearly
impossible to understand why, or even how, the algorithm is judging applicants
based on their race. On the other hand, a machine learner based on decision
trees or Bayesian networks is much more transparent to programmer inspection.
190

Bostrom and Yudkowsky's discussion cautions us that while a lay
person, and even a policymaker, might initially believe that you can assign
blame to the programmer for setting up "racist parameters," depending on
the type of machine learning being used, this might be both unfair and
futile."' We need to examine the data set, the institutional context, and the
mediating role of the machine, with the kind of critical literacy we apply in
other cases of institutional innovation.
In Gillespie's terms,1 9 2 the Bostrom and Yudkowsky's scenario asks us
to consider both the patterns of inclusion that shape the data set, and
backtracking to the evaluation of relevance produced by machine learning,
by looking first for red flags in the outputs.1 93 What we learn in this example
reflects not just on the quality of the machine learning, but goes all the way
back, prior to the algorithms, prior to the data set, to reflect on problems in
the institution of banking itself.
This points to Gillespie's fifth area of ethical concern: entanglement
with practice.19 4 We tend to think of new technology as a source of new
knowledge production, because that is the most exciting outcome - and can
be wildly useful."' But reaffirming common sense or current practice is often
useful as well, especially in institutional settings. Perhaps the outcome in
Bostrom and Yudkowsky's example should not surprise anyone. Keep in
mind that a "successful" machine learning algorithm is almost always going
to be defined as such based on being useful or at least usable in a specific

human context. It is successful if it is able to process available data in a way
that either provides its human users with something they can apply for
decision-making within pre-existing systems, or even goes ahead and makes
the decisions that will be legible and minimally disruptive in the context of
existing human institutional frameworks.
What remains troubling is the imaginary bank's response, believing that
their algorithm, simply by being an algorithm, has the power to erase the
history of their racist and predatory lending policies. This points to
Gillespie's fourth area of concern: the rhetorical promise of objectivity is
taking at least as large a role in the story as the program's actual computing
capacities.196 In fact, it is a successful example of machine learning precisely
because it has learned on its own to apply to the future the racist and
predatory policies it learned from the past. The promise of objectivity
becomes a sort of invisibility cloak, wrapping up pre-existing social bias and
re-engraining it, causing moral, and possibly legal agency to quietly
disappear in the process.
The ethical discussion, framed around Gillespie's Model9 7 allows us to
discuss new issues as they arise within the field, and to better inform
corporate decision-making about the use of collected data from machine
learning. It is only with a continuing robust discussion as new uses of data
and ever increasing amalgamation of data can we begin to design regulation
that matches the expectations of society.
CONCLUSION

Big Data is already being used in many settings with positive outcomes.
For example, the FTC report referenced above notes that use of Big Data
(and analytic techniques) can identify students who are at risk of dropping
out and in need of early intervention strategies," examine academic
disciplinary actions that are disproportionately impacting certain
populations,"' provide access to credit to a larger segment of the population

healthcare,201 and to provide healthcare into underserved communities.202 But
the report also notes that there have also been instances of Big Data misuse.
For example, the FTC took action against one credit card company because
it failed to disclose its practice of rating consumers as having a greater credit
risk because they used their cards to pay for marriage counseling, therapy,
or tire-repair services.203 And, at least one example exists of online
companies charging consumers in different zip codes different prices for
standard office products.204
Given that comprehensive regulation is unlikely in this area for the
foreseeable future outside of the EU context, firms will need to make the
proactive decision of how they should ethically use the massive amounts of
data being generated through machine learning processes. We argue that the
most productive path forward is for corporate decision-makers is to leverage
the power of polycentricity and proactively promote ethical Big Data norm
building. This could include incorporating best practices from related
contexts, such as cybersecurity, which has seen the rise of Information
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Organizations (ISAOs) to share
cyber threat data and best practices between members. The same could be
done in the Big Data context with regards to privacy threats and best
practices.205 Without such polycentric action, the warnings of science fiction
could soon become reality.
