Abstract — Search engines are one of the primary
ways that Internet users find Web sites. For that
reason a Web site with good search engine listings
may see a dramatic increase in traffic. Everyone
wants those good listings. Unfortunately, many Web
sites appear poorly in search engine rankings or
may not be listed at all because they fail to consider
how search engines work.
In particular, submitting to search engines is only
part of the challenge of getting good search engine
positioning. So it is important to prepare a Web site
through Search Engine Optimization. Search
engine optimization means ensuring that Web pages
/ Web sites are accessible to search engines and are
focused in ways that help improve the chances they
will be found.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has proven to be
one of the most cost-effective forms of marketing
available. But using search engine optimization, one
can retrieve information from one search engine
only. It cannot access various search engines at a
time. There is need of Adaptive Search Engine
which will give flexibility to user to have choice of
particular search engine from single user interface.

I. INTRODUCTION
Search engines are one of the primary ways that
Internet users find Web sites. For that reason a Web site
with good search engine listings may see a dramatic
increase in traffic. The main challenge is to provide
efficient search techniques with adaptive approach.
People basically require good listings. Unfortunately,
many Web sites appear poorly in search engine
rankings or may not be listed at all because they fail to
consider how search engines work.
In particular, submitting to search engine is only part of
the challenge of getting good search engine
positioning. Search engine optimization means
ensuring that Web pages / Web sites are accessible to
search engines and are focused in ways that help
improve the chances they will be found. So, that is for
particular search engine.
This paper introduces concept of adaptive user
interface for search engines. Single interface will allow

people to have their own choice of search engine. As
per choice of search engine query will be fired to
selected search engine only.
II. SEARCH ENGINE
A search engine is a tool used to search for information
on the Web (WWW). The search results are generally
presented in a list of results and are commonly called
hits. The information may consist of , information and
other types of files. Some search engines also mine data
available in databases or open directories. Unlike Web
directories, which are maintained by human editors, the
search engines operate algorithmically or are a mixture
of algorithmic and human input.
III. USER ADAPTIVR SYSTEMS
User adaptive systems may improve the experiences of
users when handling computer systems. The user
adaptive systems perform incremental behavior
analysis to model the user and use this knowledge to
personalize them. As not all users are equal, this allows
systems to take into account a minority instead of being
forced to do what is best for the majority of users. [2]
Besides taking into account the specific need of users,
user adaptive systems also provide new opportunities
for improvement of the user experience. [2]
IV. USER ADAPTIVE SEARCH ENGINE
A user adaptive search engine might for example
provide a personalized search option that takes into
account the user's interests. [2] One can think about
choices of various search engines on single user
interface to get ranked results on screen.
V. SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
The term search engine describes a diverse set of
activities that one can perform to increase the number
of desirable visitors who come to the website via search
engines. [3]
VI. OPTIMIZATION OF SEARCH ENGINE
Success is biased at being top of the rankings in most of
cases. The top-ranked site for a search does better than
number two or three and the top few get many times
more visits than the results at the bottom of the first
page which is but obvious, which in turn get many
times more clicks than results on page number 2, 3,
4,etc. The skew is great that the benefits of getting
higher up the rankings far outweigh the costs. One can
optimize web sites to get high rankings. The main aim
here is to get in the top 5 or 10 results for one or more

specific search terms. [6]
VII. HOW SEARCH ENGINE RANK WEB
PAGES?
Search for anything using crawler-based search engine.
Nearly instantly, the search engine will sort through the
thousands of pages it knows about and present person
with ones that match particular topic. The matches will
even be ranked; as a result the most relevant ones come
first. The search engines don't always get it right. Nonrelevant pages make it through, and sometimes it may
take a little more digging to find what person looking
for actually. But, by and large, search engines do a
wonderful job. [6]
VIII. ABOUT RANKING ALGORITHM
The main rule in a ranking algorithm involves the
location and frequency of keywords on a web page.
Search engine will also check to see if the search
keywords appear near the top of a web page, like in the
headline or in the first few paragraphs or parts of text.
They suppose that any page relevant to the topic will
mention those words right from the beginning.
Frequency is the additional major factor in how search
engine determine relevancy. A search engine will
analyze how often keywords appear in relation to other
words in a web page. Those with a higher occurrence
are often deemed more relevant than other web pages.
IX. QUALIFY THE LOCATION / FREQUENCY
METHOD
Search engines add interest to the location or frequency
method. No one does it exactly the same, which is one
reason why the same search on different search engines
produces different results.
To begin with, some search engines index more web
pages than others. Some search engines also index web
pages more frequently than others. The result is that no
search engine has the exact same collection of web
pages to search from end to end. So, that naturally
produces differences, when comparing their results.
Search engines may also penalize pages or reject them
from the index, if they detect search engine spamming.
An example is when a word is repeated several number
of times on a page, to increase the frequency and push
the page higher in the listings.
X. ON AND OFF PAGE COMPONENTS OF
SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
Search Engine Optimization is mainly achieved by the
combination of two key factors generally on page and
off page factors.
A. On page factors
On page optimization includes all components directly
related to the website. It includes the content available
on the website and the structure that holds together the
content. There are several basic ideas of on page
optimization that are important to know about like
optimization of all meta tags which mainly includes
title, keywords, description, etc. [5]

Volume-1 Issue-2

B. Off page factors
In its simplest form, off-page optimization can be
referred to as increasing a website's popularity. This
popularity is defined by the number and types of
websites that link to a given website or URL. [4] Offpage optimization is the most important SEO strategy
for those seeking #1 placement on a particular search
engine. Off-page optimization is the practice of
increasing a site's popularity. The fastest and most
effective way to achieve this goal is by developing
quality link to the website for that one can use related
meta tags. [4]
XI. SEO PERSPECTIVE
Two important concepts crawlability and indexation
are important in Search Engine architecture. Even
though the two concepts are intricately related, they are
not the same.
Crawling basically refers to the search engines'
fetching process, when search engine spiders follow
links from web page to web page. During the crawling
process, pages are not available to rank. Before pages
are added to an index, they must pass through a number
of filters before they are available to rank. This second
process is called indexation. Crawling precedes
indexation. There is a need of retrieving information
from various search engines. So, there is a requirement
of adaptive user search engine interface.
XII. CONCLUSION
The search engines need to take all major factors into
consideration each time they show results to their
searchers. The goal of the search engine is to categorize
all the information on the web and rank it by its
relevance for the search terms typed into the search bar.
The process of getting the website to the top of the
search engines is known as search engine optimization.
But accessing multiple search engines at the same time
is always difficult task by search engine optimization.
In the complex world there is a need of retrieving
information from various search engines. So, there is a
requirement of adaptive search engine.
