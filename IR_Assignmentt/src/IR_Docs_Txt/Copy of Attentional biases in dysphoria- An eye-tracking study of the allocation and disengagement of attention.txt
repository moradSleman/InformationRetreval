Attentional biases in dysphoria: An eye-tracking study of
the allocation and disengagement of attention

This study looked for evidence of biases in the allocation and disengagement of attention in
dysphoric individuals. Participants studied images for a recognition memory test while their eye
fixations were tracked and recorded. Four image types were presented (depression-related, anxietyrelated, positive, neutral) in each of two study conditions. For the simultaneous study condition, four
images (one of each type) were presented simultaneously for 10 seconds, and the number of fixations
and the total fixation time to each image was measured, similar to the procedure used by Eizenman
et al. (2003) and Kellough, Beevers, Ellis, and Wells (2008). For the sequential study condition, four
images (one of each type) were presented consecutively, each for 4 seconds; to measure
disengagement of attention an endogenous cuing procedure was used (Posner, 1980). Dysphoric
individuals spent significantly less time attending to positive images than non-dysphoric individuals,
but there were no group differences in attention to depression-related images. There was also no
evidence of a dysphoria-related bias in initial shifts of attention. With respect to the disengagement
of attention, dysphoric individuals were slower to disengage their attention from depression-related
images. The recognition memory data showed that dysphoric individuals had poorer memory for
emotional images, but there was no evidence of a conventional mood-congruent memory bias.
Differences in the attentional and memory biases observed in depressed and dysphoric individuals are
discussed.

Visual attention has been a subject of intensive
study in cognitive psychology for several decades
and many of its characteristics are now understood
(Pashler, 1998; Wright & Ward, 2008). It is
generally agreed that there can be only one focus

of attention at any one time, that the scope of
attention is quite limited, and that only information selected to be attended undergoes extensive
processing. As a consequence, when multiple
sources of information compete for attention, an

individual must prioritise its allocation, shifting the
focus of his or her attention from one source to
another. Researchers studying selective attention
in clinical populations have discovered attentional
biases in the allocation of attention, such that
concern-related or mood-congruent material is
given priority. One of the most well-documented
attentional biases is the bias associated with high
levels of anxiety: researchers have found that
anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli, and that anxious individuals focus their
attention preferentially on stimuli related to danger
and threat (see Calvo & Avero, 2005; Mogg &
Bradley, 2005, for reviews).
The evidence for an attentional bias in depression is less convincing. According to cognitive
schema models (Beck, 1976; Beck & Clark, 1988),
depression is caused and maintained by biases in
the processing of emotion-congruent information,
and a key prediction is that depressed individuals
should selectively attend to and remember emotion-congruent information. Contrary to this prediction, in many studies depressed individuals do
not exhibit an attentional bias (see Mogg &
Bradley, 2005; Rinck & Becker, 2005, for reviews).
As Mogg and Bradley noted, however, most
studies have used the emotional Stroop task and
the visual probe task. While these tasks have
proved to be useful tools for the study of attention
in depression, the mixed findings in the literature
are likely partly related to the various limitations of
these tasks. Neither task provides a full picture of
attentional processing, because they do not differentiate between the different components of
attention (such as the maintenance of attention
versus the disengagement of attention) and because
processing is measured over brief intervals of time
(typically 1 second or less). Ideally, researchers
should measure the focus of attention throughout
an extended interval in which multiple stimuli
compete for attention, from initial orienting to
subsequent shifts of attention between competing
stimuli. Eye-movement tracking and recording can
provide such information because the direction of
an individual’s gaze and the focus of their attention
are tightly coupled (Wright & Ward, 2008).
Although only a few studies have used eye-gaze

1350

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

tracking to look for attentional biases in depressed
and dysphoric individuals, the evidence for
attentional biases is much clearer in these studies.

Previous eye-tracking studies
Caseras, Garner, Bradley, and Mogg (2007) presented dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants
with pairs of images to examine shifts of attention
to positive, negative, and neutral scenes. The image
pairs were presented for 3 seconds and consisted of
a neutral image paired with either a positive or a
negative image. The participant’s task was to
respond to a central fixation target (an asterisk or
a circle), presented between the two images, as
quickly and accurately as possible. Although the
task did not require participants to attend to the
images, Caseras et al. reported that on 99% of trials
there was a shift in gaze to one of the images of the
pair. On each trial, the type of image (positive,
negative, or neutral) that was first fixated was
recorded, in addition to the latency of the first shift
in gaze and the duration of gaze on the first fixated
image. Caseras et al. found that dysphoric and nondysphoric participants did not differ in their initial
orienting to images: for both groups there was a
bias to shift attention toward positive images and
away from negative images, relative to neutral
images. For both groups gaze durations were
longer for negative images than for neutral
images, but the difference between negative and
neutral images was larger for dysphoric participants
(188 ms) than for non-dysphoric participants
(100 ms). This interaction was not present for the
positiveneutral image pairs. Caseras et al. concluded that dysphoria is characterised by a bias in
the maintenance of attention on negative information but not the initial orienting of attention. They
speculated that the bias to maintain attention on
negative images may reflect a difficulty disengaging
attention from negative information, a possibility
examined in the present study.
Three studies have used eye-gaze tracking to
examine attention to emotional images over longer
intervals (Eizenman et al., 2003; Kellough,
Beevers, Ellis, & Wells, 2008; Mathews & Antes,
1992). Mathews and Antes presented participants

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

with seven images, each for 20 seconds, and tracked
participants’ eye movements while they examined
these images (the participant’s task was to make an
aesthetic judgement for each image). Each image
contained spatially separate ‘‘happy’’ and ‘‘sad’’
regions (e.g., one of the images was a painting
depicting an animal skull beside a flower), and the
number of fixations and fixation durations to these
regions was measured. Mathews and Antes found
that both dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants fixated happy regions significantly more
frequently than sad regions, and that the two
groups did not differ in how frequently they fixated
happy regions. The two groups did differ on how
frequently they fixated sad regions, with dysphoric
participants fixating sad regions significantly more
frequently than non-dysphoric participants. For
fixation durations there were no statistically significant between-group differences, although the
trend was for dysphoric participants to fixate on sad
regions longer than non-dysphoric participants
and to fixate on happy regions less. Mathews and
Antes concluded that their results provided some
support for a dysphoria-related bias in the allocation of attention, but argued that their more
important finding was the evidence of a powerful
positive cognitive bias that was only attenuated by
negative mood.
Eizenman et al. (2003) tracked the eye movements of a small group of depressed individuals
(n8) and a matched sample of non-depressed
individuals (n9) while they examined 15 slides
of images, each slide containing four images.
There were eight critical slides, and each critical
slide contained an image with a neutral theme, an
image with a dysphoric theme, an image with a
threatening theme, and an image with a positive/
social theme. The participants were asked to
examine the images in any manner they wished
throughout the 10.5-second presentation time.
Eizenman et al. found that depressed individuals
spent more time attending to dysphoric images than
non-depressed individuals, as their total fixation
durations to the dysphoric images were significantly
longer. Eizenman et al. did not find that depressed
individuals attended to positive images any differently than non-depressed individuals. Eizenman

et al. also reported that depressed individuals
had significantly longer average glance durations
for dysphoric images, and speculated that this
reflected a difficulty in shifting attention away
from dysphoric images.
Kellough et al. (2008) recently reported on a
study similar to that of Eizenman et al. (2003).
Using a similar procedure and the same image
types, participants viewed 12 sets of 4 images over a
longer period (30 seconds per set) so that changes
in the allocation of attention over time could be
examined. Like Eizenman et al., Kellough et al.
found that clinically depressed individuals spent a
significantly greater percentage of time attending
to dysphoric images than non-depressed individuals, and time-course analyses indicated that this
bias was maintained over an entire 30-second trial.
Unlike Eizenman et al., they also found that
depressed individuals spent a significantly smaller
percentage of time viewing positive images
than non-depressed individuals. Kellough et al.
also looked at which image types were fixated first
on each trial and found no group differences,
consistent with Caseras et al.’s (2007) finding
that there is no depression-related bias in the
initial orienting of attention.

Disengagement of attention in dysphoria
and depression
Previous eye-tracking studies have examined biases
in the initial orientation and allocation of attention
in depression and dysphoria. Although researchers
have speculated that depressed individuals have
difficulty disengaging attention from depressionrelated stimuli (Bradley, Mogg, & Lee, 1997;
Caseras et al., 2007; Eizenman et al., 2003), only
a few studies have tested this possibility using a task
that explicitly required participants to disengage
their attention from a stimulus, and none have used
eye tracking to monitor attentional disengagement.
Ellenbogen and Schwartzman (2009) used a
modified spatial cueing task to assess the speed
of disengagement from pictorial cues depicting
dysphoria, threat, and neutral content. Clinically
depressed and control participants were instructed
to quickly respond to a target (a black dot)
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

SEARS ET AL.

presented on the left or right of a central fixation
marker. The target was preceded by a supraluminal
(750 ms presentation) or a masked pictorial cue
(17 ms presentation), which was either a dysphoric,
threatening, or neutral image. On 78% of the trials
the cue was valid, such that the target appeared in
the same location as the cue, and on 22% of the
trials the cue was invalid, such that the target
appeared in the location opposite the cue. The
invalid cue trials were the trials of interest.
Ellenbogen and Schwartzman reasoned that on
invalid cue trials, participants would disengage
their attention from the cue because the appearance
of the target would automatically capture attention, and hence response latencies on these trials
would reflect ease of attentional disengagement.
Ellenbogen and Schwartzman found that depressed individuals were slower to disengage from
supraluminal dysphoric image cues than from
neutral image cues (a 15 ms difference), whereas
for non-depressed individuals the disengagement
times from dysphoric and neutral images were
nearly identical. There were no group differences
for masked image cues or for those depicting
threat. Ellenbogen and Schwartzman concluded
that their results demonstrated that the disengagement of attention from negative information was
impaired in depression.
A similar conclusion was reached by Koster, De
Raedt, Goeleven, Frank, and Crombez (2005),
who examined the disengagement of attention
from positive and negative words in dysphoric
and non-dysphoric individuals. Like Ellenbogen
and Schwartzman (2009), Koster et al. used a
modified spatial cueing task and responses on
invalidly cued trials to measure attentional disengagement. On each trial a target (a black rectangle),
presented on the left or right of a central fixation
marker, was preceded by a positive, negative, or
neutral word, presented for 1500 ms. On 50% of
the trials the cue word was invalid, such that the
target appeared in the location opposite the cue.
Koster et al. found that dysphoric participants were
slower to disengage attention from negative word
cues than from neutral word cues (a 12 ms
difference), whereas non-dysphoric participants
were not. (For positive words the opposite outcome

1352

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

was observed.) They concluded that attentional
disengagement from negative words was impaired
in dysphoria.

The present study
The purpose of our study was to examine
dysphoria-related biases in the orientation, maintenance, and disengagement of attention, using
an eye-tracking system to continuously monitor
participants’ gaze while viewing emotional
images. Our study was partly motivated by some
of the inconsistent results between the studies that
tested dysphoric individuals (Caseras et al., 2007;
Mathews & Antes, 1992) and those that tested
clinically depressed individuals (Eizenman et al.,
2003; Kellough et al., 2008). For example,
whereas Caseras et al. found that dysphoric
individuals did not attend to positive images
any differently than non-dysphoric individuals,
Kellough et al. found that clinically depressed
individuals attended to positive images less than
non-depressed individuals. The possibility of
generalising from a dysphoric student sample to
a clinically diagnosed sample has been debated in
the literature for some time (e.g., Cox, Enns,
Borger, & Parker, 1999; Flett, Vredenburg, &
Lester, 1997; Vredenburg, Flett, & Krames,
1993), but there are too few studies on attentional
processing in depressed and dysphoric individuals
to know if the same concerns are applicable. In
the present study, we examined attentional processing in dysphoric individuals using a task that
allowed direct comparisons with the data collected
by Eizenman et al. and Kellough et al. from
clinically depressed individuals.
An important difference between our procedure and those of Eizenman et al. (2003) and
Kellough et al. (2008) is that we showed
participants several hundred images and asked
them to study the images for a recognition
memory test. An advantage of having participants
study the images (as opposed to merely viewing
the images) is that it provided them with a clear
purpose and motivation for attending to the
images, likely an important consideration when
assessing individual differences in the distribution

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

of attention. Our study is one of the few to use
images and a recognition task to test for moodcongruent memory; most studies have examined
memory for valenced and neutral words using
recall tasks (see Burt, Zembar, & Niederehe,
1995; Matt, Vazquez, & Campbell, 1992;
Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1997,
for reviews). A recent study by Hamilton and
Gotlib (2008) showed that non-depressed individuals had better recognition memory for positive
images than for negative images, whereas for
depressed individuals positive and negative
images were remembered equally well. Our study
allowed for an equivalent test of recognition
memory in dysphoric individuals.
Our study was also motivated by the fact that
researchers have not examined the endogenous
disengagement of attention in depression or dysphoria. An important distinction in attention
research is between the exogenous and endogenous
cueing of attention*in the exogenous cueing
paradigm the observer’s attention is automatically
drawn to a location by the abrupt onset of a
peripheral cue, whereas in the endogenous cueing
paradigm the cue is typically a directional arrow
that directs the observer to intentionally move their
attention in the direction of the cue (Posner, 1980).
In the exogenous cuing paradigm shifts of attention are stimulus driven, automatic, and reflexive,
whereas in the endogenous cueing paradigm
they are volitional and under the control of the
observer. Both Ellenbogen and Schwartzman
(2009) and Koster et al. (2005) used an exogenous
cueing paradigm to examine attentional disengagement. Endogenous and exogenous attentional
cueing are not equivalent; in fact, quantitative
and qualitative differences between them have led
to debate over whether both types of cues recruit
the same unitary attentional mechanism or
whether they recruit separate attentional systems
(Klein & Shore, 2000; Wright & Ward, 2008). We
suspected that an endogenous cueing procedure
would be an ideal way of testing for a dysphoriarelated bias in the disengagement of attention,
because shifts of endogenous attention reflect more
conscious cognitive processing than shifts of
exogenous attention and because endogenous

cues can be used to assess an individual’s ability to
interrupt their processing of negative information.
Our main research questions were as follows:
(1) Would dysphoric individuals attend to depression-related and positive images differently than
non-dysphoric individuals? (2) Would dysphoric
individuals be slower to disengage attention from
depression-related images? (3) Would there be
differences between dysphoric and non-dysphoric
individuals in their recognition memory for
emotional images?

METHOD
Participants studied four types of images (depression-related, anxiety-related, positive, neutral) in
two study conditions (the simultaneous study
condition and the sequential study condition).
These conditions differed in the way the images
were presented and the components of attention
examined (the allocation and maintenance of
attention in the simultaneous study condition;
the disengagement of attention in the sequential
study condition). For the simultaneous study
condition, on each trial four images (one of each
image type) were presented simultaneously for 10
seconds, similar to the procedure used by Eizenman et al. (2003). Participants could study the
images in any manner they wished, and throughout the 10 seconds the number of fixations to each
image and the amount of time spent looking at
each image were recorded.
For the sequential study condition, on each
trial four images (one of each image type) were
presented consecutively, each for 4 seconds.
Participants were asked to study each image for
the recognition memory test. To measure disengagement of attention, images were probed
occasionally by presenting a superimposed, semitransparent arrow in the centre of the image that
pointed to one of the four corners of the display
(an endogenous attention cue; Posner, 1980); the
participants’ task was to immediately move their
gaze off the image in the direction the arrow was
pointing whenever the probe appeared. Participants had to remain vigilant throughout each trial
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

1353

SEARS ET AL.

because both the appearance of a probe and the
direction the probe pointed to were not predictable. The key dependent variable was the speed
with which the participant could move their gaze
off a probed image. Slower disengagement times
were taken to reflect greater difficulty moving
attention away from the image.

Participants
The participants were 129 undergraduate students
from the University of Calgary who volunteered
to participate in the study in exchange for extra
course credit. To control for gender only females
were recruited for the study. To be eligible to
participate, students were required to have normal
or corrected-to-normal vision and could not wear
eyeglasses during data collection because of the
potential for interference with the eye gaze
recording. The mean age of the participants was
20.8 years (range of 18 to 44).
Participants completed the second edition of
the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck,
Steer, & Brown, 1996), the Positive and Negative
Affect Scale (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI;
Steer & Beck, 1997), and a demographics questionnaire. The BDI is a self-report inventory
consisting of 21 items that assesses participants’
depressive symptoms over the past two weeks.
Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, with
summary scores ranging between 0 and 63. (To
comply with institutional ethics requirements the
item dealing with suicidal intent was removed, and
therefore the maximum score was 60.) The PANAS assesses participants’ pleasant and unpleasant
mood states. It consists of 20 words that describe
different emotions (e.g., excited, proud, upset,
guilty, distressed); participants read each word
and indicate ‘‘to what extent you have felt this
way’’, using a scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all)
to 5 (extremely). These same 20 words were rated
for two time frames: ‘‘during the past few days’’ and
‘‘during the past few weeks’’. For the 10 positive
affect items and for the 10 negative affect items the
minimum score was 10 and the maximum score
was 50. The BAI is a self-report inventory

1354

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

consisting of 21 items, each item describing a
common symptom of anxiety. The participant is
asked to rate how much she or he has been
bothered by each symptom over the past week on
a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3
(severely*it bothered me a lot). The demographic
questionnaire included questions about previous
episodes of depression, experiences with psychotherapy, and recent changes in mood.
Participants were assigned to groups based on
their BDI scores. Participants in the dysphoric
group had BDI scores greater than or equal to 20,
the BDI cut-off score recommended by Dozois,
Dobson, and Ahnberg (1998) for a ‘‘dysphoric
depressed’’ classification when using undergraduate samples. There were 20 participants in the
dysphoric group (mean age22.2). For the nondysphoric group we selected participants with
BDI scores less than or equal to 6, a lower cutoff than recommended by Dozois et al. (they
recommended a score less than or equal to 12).
Using a lower cut-off allowed us to create a
greater separation between the groups, and
because of the large number of participants in
our study (N129) we could still assign a large
number of participants to the non-dysphoric
group (N52, mean age21.1). The dysphoric
group had significantly higher BDI scores than
the non-dysphoric group, M25.1 (SD3.9)
versus M3.1 (SD2.2), t (70)29.7, pB.01,
and significantly higher BAI scores, M22.6
(SD7.6) versus M9.4 (SD5.2), t (70)
8.28, pB.01. The dysphoric group had higher
scores on the PANAS negative items (‘‘during the
past few days’’), M26.6 (SD6.6) versus M
16.2 (SD4.8), t (70)7.24, pB.01, and significantly lower scores on the PANAS positive
items (‘‘past few days’’), M22.1 (SD4.5)
versus M32.9 (SD6.6), t (70)6.60, pB.01.
Dysphoric participants reported more episodes
of depression, with 57.8% reporting ‘‘two to five’’
episodes of depression in the past few years
compared to 19.2% of non-dysphoric participants,
x2(1)9.99, pB.01. Almost all of the dysphoric
participants reported that their last depressive
episode was within the past year (92.8%), compared to 31.8% of the non-dysphoric participants

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

who reported previous depressive episodes,
x2(1)17.92, pB.01. Most of the dysphoric
participants reported having felt depressed lately
(73.8%), whereas none (0%) of the non-dysphoric
participants did.

Stimuli
The stimuli were 720 colour images, divided
equally between four categories: depressionrelated, anxiety-related, positive, and neutral.
Most of the images (540) were collected from the
Internet, and the other 180 were taken from the
International Affective Picture System database
(Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005). The depression-related images included scenes of people
appearing sad and unhappy, neglected animals
(e.g., a puppy in a small steel cage), scenes of
poverty, and dark, gloomy landscapes. The anxietyrelated images involved themes of threat and
injury, and included scenes of people being threatened with weapons, people with physical injuries
(e.g., an untreated burn on an arm), dangerous
situations (a person walking along a cliff), vehicle
accidents, and threatening animals. The positive
images showed people smiling and laughing,
children playing, rabbits and kittens, and vacation
activities and destinations (e.g., a beach at a tropical
resort). The neutral images were selected to include
people in various activities and to have no obvious
positive or negative theme (e.g., a woman talking
on the telephone, a group of people having a
meeting). They also included pictures of objects
(e.g., a bicycle, a computer) and a variety of neutral
landscapes (e.g., office buildings). The 720 images
used in the study were selected from a larger set of
images (1000) assembled by the four authors; an
image was selected for use in the study only if the
majority agreed to its category (depression-related,
anxiety-related, positive, or neutral).
From the set of 720 images, 120 critical images
were chosen, divided equally between the depression-related, anxiety-related, positive, and neutral
categories (participants were shown all 720 images
in the experiment). These consisted of all 80
images shown in the simultaneous study condition
(20 from each category) and the 40 probed images

shown in the sequential study condition (10 from
each category). All the data collected in the study
was from these 120 critical images, the other 600
images being used as filler (non-probed) images in
the sequential study condition. Prior to the study,
the critical images were categorised by an independent group of raters. These were 33 female
undergraduate students (none of whom participated in the present study) who were shown a total
of 320 images, one at a time on a computer display
and in a random order, and were asked to choose
one of four categories that best described each
image: (1) positive/happy; (2) sad/depressing/
gloomy; (3) anxiety-provoking/dangerous/fearful;
and (4) neutral/no emotion. An image was chosen
for use as a critical image if at least 90% of the raters
agreed to its category.

Apparatus
Eye movements were recorded by an EyeLink I eye
tracking system (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada), which uses infrared video-based
tracking technology. Participants wore a small,
lightweight headband equipped with cameras positioned below the eyes that tracked the position of
the pupils as they moved. The system has an average
gaze error of less than 0.5 degrees and a sampling
rate of 250 Hz (allowing for a temporal resolution
of 4 ms). The EyeLink system is designed to
compensate for small changes in head position
during tracking so a head rest is not necessary. The
eye-tracking system was connected to a Dell
Dimension 8300 computer and a ViewSonic
G225fb 21-inch flat-screen monitor with a vertical
retrace rate of 160 Hz. The computer controlled the
visual display and recorded the horizontal and
vertical co-ordinates corresponding to the position
of the right eye every 4 ms (eye movements were
recorded from the participant’s right eye only). Eye
movements were tracked and recorded continuously throughout each trial.

Procedure
Participants were fitted with the headband camera
when they arrived for the study and then the eyetracking system was calibrated. Participants were
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

1355

SEARS ET AL.

provided with written and spoken instructions at
the beginning of the session. They were told that
they would be studying images for a recognition
memory test and that their eye movements would
be recorded while they studied the images. They
were asked to study the images carefully because
their memory for the images would be tested
seven days later.
As noted, participants studied images in two
study conditions: the simultaneous study condition and the sequential study condition. The trials
for the two study conditions were blocked, with
the trials for the simultaneous study condition
always presented first (due to concerns with carryover effects from the sequential study condition to
the simultaneous study condition, but not vice
versa). For the simultaneous study condition,
participants were shown four images on each trial:
a depression-related image, an anxiety-related
image, a positive image, and a neutral image.
One image was placed in each of the four corners
of the display (top left, top right, bottom left,
bottom right). Images were randomly assigned to
the four corners of the display, and across all
of the trials each image type was equally likely
to appear in each corner. All the images were
325243 pixels in size and were presented at a
display resolution of 1024  768 pixels on a
white background. At the start of each trial
participants fixated on a black dot in the centre
of the display for three seconds. The four images
were then presented for 10 seconds, and participants proceeded to study the images in any order
they wished. Eye movements were tracked and
recorded continuously throughout each trial.
There were 24 trials in total, the first four trials
being practice trials to familiarise participants
with the procedures before data collection began.
For the sequential study condition, participants
were shown four images, one at a time, one from
each of the depression-related, anxiety-related,
positive, and neutral categories. A trial sequence is
shown in Figure 1. At the start of each trial,
participants fixated on a black dot in the centre of
the display for three seconds. The first image was
then presented in the upper left corner of the
display, for four seconds, and was then covered

1356

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

with a solid grey rectangle to prevent further
study. The second image then appeared in the top
right corner of the display, for four seconds, and
was then covered by a solid grey rectangle. This
sequence continued for the third and fourth
images, with the third image presented in the
bottom left corner of the display and the fourth
image in the bottom right corner. Participants
were asked to study each image for the recognition memory test. The four image types were
randomly assigned to one of the four corners of
the display, and across the 160 trials each image
type was equally likely to appear in each corner.
To measure the disengagement of attention, on
25% of the trials one of the four images was
probed by presenting a semi-transparent arrow in
the centre of the image that pointed to one of the
four corners of the display. As shown in Figure 1,
each corner of the display contained a solid black
fixation marker (); when a probe appeared, the
participant’s task was to immediately move their
gaze to the fixation marker the probe arrow was
pointing to. Participants kept their gaze on the
cued fixation marker until the next image
appeared and then moved their gaze to the new
image to study it. The 40 probe trials were
randomly distributed among the set of 160 trials,
with an equal number of depression-related,
anxiety-related, positive, and neutral images being
probed. Probe arrows were equally likely to point
to the four corners of the display. When an image
was probed, the arrow appeared either 1.5, 2.0,
2.5, or 3.0 seconds (randomly determined) after
the onset of the image. Participants therefore had
to remain vigilant throughout each trial because
the appearance of a probe and the direction the
probe arrow pointed to were not predictable.
Each participant’s session was divided into five
blocks of trials. The first block consisted of 4
practice trials for the simultaneous study condition, followed by 20 data trials. After a short break
the second block of trials began, which consisted
of 6 practice trials for the sequential study
condition (three of them probe trials), followed
by 40 data trials. The three remaining blocks
consisted of trials for the sequential study condition (40 trials per block).

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

Figure 1. An example of a trial sequence in the sequential study condition. At the start of a trial (t 1) the participant fixated on the
marker at the centre of the display, for 2000 ms. The first image then appeared in the upper left corner (t 2) and the participant moved
their gaze to the image to study it. After 4 seconds had elapsed the image was replaced by a solid grey rectangle to prevent further study and
then the next image appeared (t3), again for 4 seconds. In this example, the third image in the sequence (t 4), a depression-related
image, is probed by presenting an arrow cue pointing to the upper right corner of the display; the participant’s task was to move their gaze to
the fixation marker in the corner as soon as the probe appeared and to keep their gaze at that location until the next image appeared (t 5).

Participants were reminded of the recognition
memory test before leaving the laboratory
and told to expect an e-mail with further
instructions in seven days. The e-mail sent to
participants included detailed instructions and a
hypertext link to the recognition memory test.
The memory test was administered via the
Internet using the Survey Monkey website
(www.surveymonkey.com) and could be completed from any computer with Internet access.
Participants were asked to complete the memory
test (in private) as soon as possible after receiving
their e-mail notification. Participants who did
not complete the memory test within three days
of receiving their first e-mail were sent a second
e-mail notification.
Participants were shown 320 images for the
recognition memory test, one image at a time, and
were asked to choose one of four responses for each

image: ‘‘sure old’’, ‘‘guess old’’, ‘‘sure new’’, or ‘‘guess
new’’. This procedure provided information on
both the accuracy and the confidence of a participant’s response, unlike simple ‘‘yes’’ and ‘‘no’’
response options. The 320 images included the
80 images shown in the simultaneous study condition and the 40 probed images shown in the
sequential study condition (i.e., the 120 critical
images). There were also 40 randomly selected
non-probed images shown in the sequential study
condition (equally divided between the four image
categories) and 160 ‘‘new’’ images that participants
did not study (equally divided between the
four image categories). The instructions were as
follows: ‘‘If you are sure the picture is one you
studied, choose Sure Old. If you are not sure but
guess that the picture is one you studied, choose
Guess Old. If you are sure the picture is not one you
studied, choose Sure New. If you are not sure but

guess the picture is one you did not study, choose
Guess New’’. Participants were informed that 50%
of the images were ‘‘old’’ images they had studied in
the laboratory and 50% were new images they had
not studied.

RESULTS
The data from the simultaneous study condition
and the data from the sequential study condition
were analysed separately. For some participants,
data from both the simultaneous study condition
and the sequential study condition was not available
due to calibration loss, inadequate gaze tracking, or
other equipment failure; as a consequence, the
number of participants in the two analyses was not
identical. The data from the simultaneous study
condition are shown in Tables 1 and 2; the data
from the sequential study condition are shown in
Tables 2 and 3 and in Figure 2.

Simultaneous study condition
For the eye-movement data, the dependent
measures were the number of fixations to each
image type (depression-related, anxiety-related,

positive, neutral), the amount of time spent
looking at each image type (total fixation time,
measured in milliseconds), the type of image
initially fixated on each trial, and the total fixation
time for initially fixated images (measured in
milliseconds). To be included in the analyses a
fixation had to be at least 100 ms in duration.
These measures were computed for each image
type for each trial and then averaged over all 20
trials. For all analyses, the critical statistical test
was the interaction between Group (dysphoric vs.
non-dysphoric) and Image Type (depressionrelated, anxiety-related, positive, neutral). Statistically significant interactions were followed up by
testing for differences between means using
planned t-tests and an alpha of 5% to maximise
statistical power.
Type of image initially fixated. At the start of
each trial participants were fixating at the centre
of the display; when the four images appeared
they moved their gaze to one of the images to
study it. Like Caseras et al. (2007), we reasoned
that the first shift of gaze would be a good
measure of the initial orienting of attention. If
dysphoric individuals were more likely to first

look at depression-related images then this would
be evidence of a bias in the initial orienting of
attention.
An analysis of the type of image initially
fixated revealed an effect of Image Type, F(3,
210)5.01, MSE0.01, pB.01, partial h2 
.07, but no effect of Group and no interaction
between Group and Image Type (both FsB1).
There were more initial shifts of gaze to anxietyrelated images (27.4% of all trials) than there were
to depression-related (25.9%), positive (26.3%),
and neutral images (20.4%). Dysphoric participants fixated depression-related images first on

25.8% of trials, compared to 25.9% of trials for
non-dysphoric participants. Thus, like Caseras
et al. (2007) and Kellough et al. (2008), we found
that dysphoric individuals did not initially orient
their attention to depression-related images any
more frequently than non-dysphoric individuals.
Number of fixations and total fixation time. The
number of fixations and the total fixation times to
each image type were first analysed together using a
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
because these two measures were highly correlated
and MANOVA is designed to handle correlated

dependent variables (i.e., as the number of fixations
to an image increased, the total fixation time also
increased, with correlations ranging from .48 to .67
for the four image types).
There was an effect of Image Type, Wilk’s L
.59, F (6, 65)7.36, pB.001, partial h2 .40,
with the most fixations and the longest total
fixation times to the anxiety-related images and
the fewest fixations and shortest total fixation
times to the neutral images (see Table 1). The
effect of Group was not significant, Wilk’s L.94,
F (2, 69)2.11, p.10. Most important was the
interaction between Group and Image Type,
Wilk’s L.73, F (6, 65)3.87, pB.01, partial
h2 .26. The interaction indicated that the number of fixations and the total fixation times for the
different image types were not the same for the
two groups. The same interaction was present in
separate univariate (ANOVA) analyses of the
number of fixations, F (3, 210)2.75, MSE0.62,
pB.05, partial h2 .04, and total fixation times,
F(3, 210)3.34, MSE54,669.57, pB.05,
partial h2 .05.
The source of these interactions can be seen in
Table 1. The largest difference between the two
groups was in their attention to positive images.
Dysphoric participants made fewer fixations and
had shorter total fixation durations to positive
images than non-dysphoric participants. Follow-up

1360

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

between-group t-tests confirmed these observations: compared to non-dysphoric participants,
dysphoric participants made fewer fixations to
positive images, t (70)2.79, pB.01, and their
total fixation durations to positive images were
shorter (an average of 262 ms shorter), t (70)
3.52, pB.01. For the depression-related, anxietyrelated, and neutral images, there were no significant differences between the groups for the
number of fixations or for total fixation durations
(all ps.10).
We also analysed the total fixation times for
the first fixated images; that is, the total fixation
time on the first image fixated on each trial (one
participant from the non-dysphoric group had to
be excluded from this analysis because she did not
fixate on a neutral image first on any of the trials).
These data are also shown in Table 1. There
was an effect of Image Type, F (3, 204)6.20,
MSE229,433.01, pB.01, partial h2 .08,
and a marginally significant interaction between
Group and Image Type, F (3, 204)2.20, MSE
229,433.01, p.08, partial h2 .03. The interaction mirrored the interactions seen in the previous
analysis, with dysphoric participants looking at
positive images less than non-dysphoric participants (1769 ms vs. 2154 ms), t (69)2.78, pB
.01. The fact that this was true for the first
images fixated demonstrates that the group

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

difference in attention to positive images was
present from the beginning of each trial, as
opposed to developing over the course of the
10-second trial interval.
Recognition memory. Not all participants completed the memory test; 5 of the 52 participants in
the non-dysphoric group (9.6%) and 3 of the 20
participants in the dysphoric group (15.0%) did
not complete it. Participants in the non-dysphoric
group completed the memory test an average of
9.1 days after studying the images versus 10.0 days
for the participants in the dysphoric group,
t (62)0.91, p.10.
The recognition memory data was analysed
using the signal detection measure d-prime, which
provides a measure of recognition memory accuracy independent of decision criteria and response
bias. D-prime is calculated using hit and falsealarm rates; hit rates were created by summing the
‘‘sure old’’ and ‘‘guess old’’ responses to studied
images, and false-alarm rates were created by
summing the ‘‘sure old’’ and ‘‘guess old’’ responses
to non-studied foil images. The d-prime data are
shown in Table 2; higher values of d-prime reflect
better recognition memory. In the analysis there
was no main effect of Group (FB1), but there
was a main effect of Image Type, F (3, 186)
10.86, MSE0.14, pB.01, partial h2 .14, and
a Group  Image Type interaction, F (3, 186)
3.89, MSE0.14, pB.01, partial h2 .05.
Follow-up comparisons did not produce any
significant between-group differences in d-prime
for depression-related, positive, or neutral images
(all ps.10), while the difference for anxietyrelated images was marginally significant (1.53 vs.
1.22, for the dysphoric and non-dysphoric groups,
respectively), t (62)1.93, p.06. Within-group
comparisons between the image types revealed
different patterns of recognition accuracy for the
dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants. For
non-dysphoric participants, d-prime was lowest
for neutral images (0.86) and significantly higher
for anxiety-related (1.22), depression-related (1.32),
and positive images (1.08), t (46)4.42, p B.01;
t (46)5.11, pB.01; and t (46)3.23, pB.01,
respectively. Thus, non-dysphoric participants had

better memory for emotional images (anxietyrelated, depression-related, and positive) than for
neutral images. For dysphoric participants a
different pattern emerged. For dysphoric participants, d-prime was higher for anxiety-related
images (1.53) than for neutral images (1.07),
t (16)4.66, pB.01, whereas for depressionrelated images (1.16) and positive images (1.09)
d-prime was equivalent to the d-prime for neutral
images (1.07), t (16)0.79, p.10, and t (16)
0.18, p.10, respectively. Thus, dysphoric participants also had better memory for anxiety-related
images than for neutral images, but unlike nondysphoric participants, their memory for depression-related and positive images was no better
than their memory for neutral images.

Sequential study condition
The key dependent measure was the disengagement time from probed images: the amount of time
elapsed between the appearance of the probe arrow
and the participant’s saccade away from the image
in response to the probe (this interval was measured
automatically by the eye tracker). Recognition
memory for all 40 probed images was also analysed
(although this memory data should be interpreted
with caution given that the participants’ studying
of the probed images was disrupted by the probes).
For all analyses, the critical statistical test was the
interaction between Group (non-dysphoric vs.
dysphoric) and Image Type (depression-related,
anxiety-related, positive, neutral).
Disengagement time from probed images. Table 3
shows the disengagement times (in milliseconds)
for each of the four image types. In the analysis
there was a main effect of Group, F (1, 61)5.47,
MSE33,463.41, pB.05, partial h2 .08, as the
dysphoric participants were slower to disengage
from the images than the non-dysphoric participants
(800 ms vs. 737 ms). There was also a main effect of
Image Type, F (3, 183)7.56, MSE10,596.97, pB
.01, partial h2.11, and a Group  Image Type
interaction, F (3, 183)3.08, MSE10,596.97,
pB.05, partial h2 .05. The slowest disengagement times were for the depression-related images
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

1361

SEARS ET AL.

(811 ms) and the fastest for the positive images
(712 ms). The Group  Image Type interaction
was due to the significant difference between the
groups on the disengagement times for depressionrelated images: dysphoric participants were 141 ms
slower than non-dysphoric participants to move
their gaze away from these images, t (61)3.11,
pB.01, whereas the two groups did not differ in
their disengagement times for positive images,
t (61)0.62, p.10, neutral images, t (61)
1.69, p.10, or anxiety-related images, t (61)
1.02, p.10. The absence of a difference for
anxiety-related images indicates that the additional
difficulty dysphoric participants experienced disengaging from depression-related images was
specific to depression-related content and did not
generalise to images with other negative or unpleasant themes.
Figure 2 shows the differences in disengagement times for the emotional image types relative
to neutral images (these data are also shown in
Table 3). An analysis of these data assessed how
much faster or slower participants moved their gaze
away from anxiety-related, depression-related, and
positive images relative to neutral images (i.e.,
using the neutral images as a baseline, like the
analyses of Ellenbogen & Schwartzman, 2009, and
Koster et al., 2005). An advantage of analysing
these index scores is that they control for overall
group differences in disengagement time (recall
that the overall disengagement times were slower
for dysphoric participants). For these data there
was also an interaction between Group and Image
Type, F (2, 122)3.53, MSE13,561.61, pB
.05, partial h2 .05. As can be seen in Table 3,
dysphoric participants were 90 ms slower to disengage from depression-related images than from
neutral images, t (14)2.46, pB.05, whereas
non-dysphoric participants were no slower to
disengage from depression-related images than
from neutral images (the 1 ms difference was not
statistically significant). Interestingly, both groups
of participants were no slower to disengage from
anxiety-related images than from neutral images,
the difference being 27 ms for the non-dysphoric
participants, t (47)1.33, p.10, and 16 ms for
the dysphoric participants, t (14)0.43, p.10.

1362

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

In contrast, both groups were significantly faster to
disengage from positive images than from neutral
images, with the difference being larger for
dysphoric participants (69 ms), t (14)3.26, pB
.05, than for non-dysphoric participants (37 ms),
t (47)3.14, pB.05. This result may be related to
the pattern of total fixation times for positive
images in the simultaneous study condition*
dysphoric participants attended to positive images
significantly less than non-dysphoric participants,
and these participants were also faster to disengage
from positive images in the sequential study
condition. Both of these results indicate that, for
dysphoric participants, positive images did not
engage attention as strongly as they did for nondysphoric participants.
Recognition memory. Table 2 lists d-primes for
the studied probed images. There was a main
effect of Image Type, F (3, 186)14.41, MSE
0.26, pB.01, partial h2 .18, with the highest dprime for anxiety-related images (1.42) and the
lowest for depression-related images (0.79). There
was no main effect of Group (FB1), but there
was a significant interaction between Group and
Image Type, F (3, 186)3.61, MSE0.26, pB
.05, partial h2 .05. Follow-up comparisons did
not produce any statistically significant betweengroup differences for any of the images types,
although the differences for anxiety-related and
depression-related images were marginally significant (both ps.09). Within-group comparisons
produced a pattern of differences consistent with
those observed in the memory data from the
simultaneous study condition. Specifically, for
non-dysphoric participants, d-prime was higher
for anxiety-related images (1.30) than for neutral
images (0.87), t (46)3.48, pB.01, whereas
d-prime for positive images (0.95) and depression-related images (0.94) was no different than
d-prime for neutral images (0.87), t (46)0.73,
p.10, and t (46)0.69, p.10, respectively.
Thus, non-dysphoric participants’ memory for
anxiety-related images was better than their
memory for neutral images, whereas their memory
for depression-related and positive images was
equivalent to their memory for neutral images.

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

For dysphoric participants, d-prime for anxietyrelated images (1.54) was significantly higher than
d-prime for neutral images (1.13), t (16)2.22,
pB.05, which indicates that their memory for
anxiety-related images was better than their
memory for neutral images (like the non-dysphoric participants). But unlike the non-dysphoric
participants, dysphoric participants’ memory for
depression-related images (d-prime0.64) and
positive images (d-prime0.81) was poorer than
their memory for neutral images (d-prime1.13),
t (16)2.91, pB.01, and t (16)2.36, pB.05,
respectively. Considered together, the recognition
data from both the simultaneous and sequential
study conditions point to small but potentially
important differences between the dysphoric and
non-dysphoric participants’ memory for depression-related and positive images.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of our study was to examine dysphoria-related biases in the orientation, allocation,
and disengagement of attention. To do so, we
tracked and recorded the eye gaze of participants
studying depression-related, anxiety-related, positive, and neutral images. Our study was one of the
few to examine biases in the allocation of attention
in dysphoric individuals and the study’s design
allowed us to make direct comparisons with the
data collected by Eizenman et al. (2003) and
Kellough et al. (2008) from clinically depressed
individuals. We turn now to a detailed consideration of the dysphoria-related differences in attention and memory that we have observed.

Dysphoria-related differences in the
allocation of attention
With respect to the allocation of attention
(examined in the simultaneous study condition),
we found that dysphoric participants attended to
positive images differently. Dysphoric participants
attended to positive images significantly less than
non-dysphoric participants, and this was true when
considering the total fixation time to positive

images (averaged across all positive images studied)
and when considering the total fixation time to
only the first image fixated on each trial. Mathews
and Antes (1992) reported an equivalent result, as
their dysphoric participants also attended to positive images less their non-dysphoric participants.
These results are consistent with the literature
showing that disturbances in positive emotional
responding are characteristic of people experiencing dysphoria; dysphoric individuals fail to demonstrate the positive or ‘‘protective’’ cognitive bias
of non-dysphoric individuals (Gotlib, McLachlan,
& Katz, 1988), manifested in the present study by a
reduction in attention to positive stimuli.
Interestingly, Kellough et al. (2008) reported an
analogous finding in a sample of clinically depressed individuals, whereas Eizenman et al.
(2003) did not; Eizenman et al. did not find that
their clinically depressed participants attended to
positive images any differently than their control
participants. This discrepancy is not easily explained
given the many similarities between the two studies
(although Eizenman et al.’s sample of depressed
participants was smaller, N8, and older, M
36.8, than Kellough et al.’s sample: N15, with an
age range of 18 to 21 years). An important issue for
future research will be to determine if both
depressed and dysphoric individuals show a reduction in attention to positive images when multiple
emotional images compete for attention.
Unlike the situation for positive images, dysphoric participants did not attend to depressionrelated images any differently than non-dysphoric
participants. In this respect our results differ
somewhat from those of Mathews and Antes
(1992), who found that dysphoric participants
fixated on the sad regions of complex images
more frequently than non-dysphoric participants.
On the other hand, for total fixation durations,
Mathews and Antes did not find that dysphoric
participants looked at sad regions significantly
longer than non-dysphoric participants, consistent
with what we observed. In contrast, in both
Eizenman et al.’s (2003) and Kellough et al.’s
(2008) study there was unambiguous evidence that
depressed participants spent more time attending
to dysphoric images. Considered together, it would
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

1363

SEARS ET AL.

appear that an attentional bias for dysphoric images
is much more pronounced in depressed individuals
than in dysphoric individuals. Although one
should be cautious generalising from the handful
of studies available (two of them with dysphoric
individuals and two with depressed individuals), if
it is confirmed that dysphoric individuals differ
from depressed individuals in their allocation
of attention to dysphoric information then this
distinction will have important theoretical and
methodological implications for depression
researchers.
We also found that dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants did not differ in their attention
to anxiety-related images, as there were no
differences between the groups on their total
fixation durations or number of fixations to these
images. An equivalent result was reported by
Eizenman et al. (2003) and Kellough et al.
(2008), who found that depressed and control
groups did not differ on fixation times to
threatening images. Thus, it seems clear that,
regardless of the high comorbidity of depression
and anxiety, depressed and dysphoric individuals
are unlike anxious individuals in that they do
not attend preferentially to stimuli related to
danger and threat.
Lastly, like Caseras et al. (2007) and Kellough
et al. (2008), we found that dysphoric participants
did not initially orient their attention to depression-related images (or to anxiety-related images)
any more frequently than non-dysphoric participants. Depression-related images did not automatically ‘‘capture’’ the attention of dysphoric
participants as they would be expected to according to some theoretical accounts of informationprocessing biases in depression (e.g., Beck &
Clark, 1988). Recall that Kellough et al. (2008)
reported the same result with a sample of
clinically depressed individuals. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence pointing
to an important difference between anxietyrelated and depression/dysphoria-related biases
in attention; namely, that high levels of anxiety
are associated with a bias in the initial orienting
of attention (with attention automatically drawn
to threat-related cues), whereas high levels of

1364

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

dysphoria are not (Calvo & Avero, 2005; Mogg
& Bradley, 2005).

Dysphoria-related differences in the
disengagement of attention
With respect to the disengagement of attention
(examined in the sequential study condition), the
novel result was that dysphoric participants were
slower than non-dysphoric participants to disengage their attention from depression-related
images. We also found that dysphoric participants
were slower to disengage their attention from
depression-related images than neutral images,
whereas for non-dysphoric participants the disengagement times for depression-related and neutral
images were virtually identical. These results show
that dysphoric individuals experience greater
difficulty shifting attention away from depression-related images once they come into the focus
of attention. Our results compliment and extend
those of Koster et al. (2005) and Ellenbogen and
Schwartzman (2009), who reported a similar
finding using an exogenous cuing task that
measured automatic shifts of attention. Our
research shows that the endogenous disengagement of attention from depression-related information is also slower in dysphoric individuals, and
whether this is also true for depressed individuals
will need to be established.
For positive images a different pattern
emerged. While both dysphoric and non-dysphoric participants were faster to disengage their
attention from positive images than from neutral
images, for dysphoric participants the difference
in disengagement times between positive and
neutral images was larger. This is an intriguing
result that will need to be replicated, especially
because Koster et al. (2005) observed a similar
result with an exogenous cuing task (see their
Table 4). (Ellenbogen & Schwartzman, 2009, did
not present positive images in their study.) If
dysphoria is associated with faster disengagement
from positive information this would imply that
positive information has a reduced ability to
engage attention, consistent with the view that

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

disturbances in positive emotional responding are
characteristic of people experiencing dysphoria.
One final point to make about the endogenous
cueing task is that dysphoric participants’ slower
disengagement times from depression-related
images was not coupled with longer fixation
durations to depression-related images in the
simultaneous study condition*one might have
expected that slower disengagement from depression-related images would be associated with
increased attention to the same type of images in
the simultaneous study condition. On the other
hand, different attentional processes were measured
in the two study conditions (the disengagement of
attention vs. the allocation and maintenance of
attention) and it is possible that attentional processes are not uniformly affected in dysphoria. It
may also be the case that the endogenous disengagement of attention is more sensitive to an
attentional bias than either the allocation or maintenance of attention over extended time intervals.
Endogenous cues assess an individual’s ability to
immediately interrupt their processing of negative
information, and this may be a particularly effective
way of measuring a mood-congruent attentional
bias. Our study was the first to use an endogenous
cuing task to test for a dysphoria-related effect on
the disengagement of attention and our results
demonstrate that this procedure has considerable
promise for future research.

Dysphoria-related differences in recognition
memory for emotional images
The results of the recognition memory test were
fairly straightforward. For images studied in the
simultaneous study condition, dysphoric participants’ memory for depression-related and positive
images was no better than their memory for neutral
images, whereas the non-dysphoric participants
had better memory for these images than for
neutral images. For probed images studied in the
sequential study condition, dysphoric participants
had poorer memory for depression-related and
positive images than neutral images, whereas the
non-dysphoric participants’ memory for these
images was equivalent to their memory for neutral

images. In neither study condition were there clear
between-group differences in recognition memory
performance. These two tests of participants’
memory for the images were not equivalent,
because the images were studied under different
circumstances (multiple images vs. single images)
and for different lengths of time. Moreover, in the
sequential study condition the endogenous cueing
procedure disrupted participant’s studying of
probed images. In the end, we have more confidence in the memory data from the simultaneous
study condition because it reflects a more conventional test of recognition memory. Nevertheless,
the data from both study conditions were consistent in showing differences between the dysphoric
and non-dysphoric participants in their memory
for emotional images (depression-related and
positive images) versus their memory for neutral
images.
To our knowledge, no other study has examined
recognition memory for neutral and emotional
images in dysphoric individuals as we have, and
thus there is no straightforward comparison available between our results and those of an equivalent
study. Nonetheless, the memory data of the nondysphoric participants in the simultaneous study
condition is consistent with the cognitive psychology literature showing that images with emotional
content tend to be better remembered than neutral
images (Bradley et al., 1997; Christianson, 1992;
Dolcos, LaBar, & Cabeza, 2005; Ochsner, 2000).
The fact that dysphoric participants did not show
this emotional enhancement of recognition memory is the outcome of interest.
As noted previously, most studies of memory in
depressed and dysphoric individuals have looked
for group differences in memory for emotionally
valenced words using recall tasks. The standard
finding is that non-dysphoric individuals recall
more positive words than negative words, depressed individuals recall more negative words
than positive words, and dysphoric participants
exhibit an ‘‘even-handedness’’ in their recollection,
remembering positive and negative words equally
well (Matt et al., 1992). Researchers have long
recognised that data from recognition memory
tasks often fail to show the same pattern, however
COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

1365

SEARS ET AL.

(White, Ratcliff, Vasey, & McKoon, 2009), and in
many studies there are no depression-related
differences in recognition memory for emotional
material (e.g., Neshat-Doost, Taghavi, Moradi,
Yule, & Dalgleish, 1998; Ridout et al., 2008). A
recent study by Hamilton and Gotlib (2008) is an
exception. Hamilton and Gotlib had participants
study positive, negative, and neutral images and
administered a recognition memory test seven days
later (as we did in our study). They found that
whereas non-depressed individuals had better
memory for positive images than for negative
images, depressed individuals did not; instead,
depressed individuals had slightly better recognition memory for negative images (although it
should be noted that the critical interaction
between Group and Type of Image was not
statistically significant in their analyses). Because
our test of recognition memory was similar to that
of Hamilton and Gotlib, our results may point to
an important difference between the memory
biases of depressed and dysphoric individuals.
That is, dysphoric individuals may not exhibit a
mood-congruent memory bias for emotional
images, but may instead fail to exhibit the standard
emotional enhancement of memory seen in nondepressed individuals. Depression researchers will
need to use recognition memory tests more
frequently for this possibility to be evaluated.
Several caveats are necessary when interpreting
our memory data. First, recognition memory is less
affected by experimental manipulations (including
between-group manipulations) than recall memory, and so our test for a mood-congruent memory
bias was likely less sensitive than it would have been
had we used a recall task. In addition, it has long
been known that recognition memory for images is
much better than it is for words (e.g., Shepard,
1967), with higher hit rates and lower false-alarm
rates over a wide range of study-test delay intervals;
indeed, hit rates for studied images can be quite
high even when memory is tested one year after
study (e.g., Dolcos et al., 2005). For these reasons,
our ability to measure a mood-congruent memory
bias for emotional images may have been quite
limited, and small differences between participants’
memory for positive and depression-related images

1366

COGNITION AND EMOTION, 2010, 24 (8)

may have been difficult to measure. Second, it is
possible that we would have obtained different
results had we not instructed our participants to
study the images (i.e., had we used an incidental
learning task). As discussed below, studying the
images may have led to a more uniform allocation
of attention to the images, and this would have
compounded any difficulties detecting group differences in recognition memory.

Considerations for future research
One consideration for future eye-tracking research is the instructions provided to participants
viewing multiple images, because differences in
the participant’s task may have qualitative and
quantitative effects on the distribution of their
attention. Recall that Eizenman et al. (2003) and
Kellough et al. (2008) asked their participants to
simply view images as they were presented (‘‘as if
they were watching television’’ in Kellough et al.’s
study), whereas Mathews and Antes (1992) asked
their participants to make an aesthetic rating for
each image and our participants were asked to
study each image for a recognition memory test.
When participants are asked to rate each image or
to study each image, it is quite likely they will
distribute their attention differently compared to
when they are asked to passively view images. For
one, every image will probably receive some minimal amount of attention, producing a more uniform distribution of attention among the images
presented during each trial. In addition, studying
or rating images probably invokes a more deliberate and elaborative type of processing of each
and every image, regardless of the image type,
which would tend to equalise the distribution
of attention throughout a trial. The end result
would be that it would be more difficult to
observe individual differences in the allocation
and maintenance of attention because any such
differences would be attenuated. Thus, it is possible that we have underestimated the impact of
dysphoria on selective attention by having participants study the images. If true, the fact that
we still observed differences between dysphoric
and non-dysphoric individuals speaks to the

ATTENTIONAL BIASES

resilience and persistence of the attentional
bias*even when the task demands encouraged
participants to attend fully and equally to all
images there was still a group difference in
attention to positive images. Researchers will
need to carefully consider task demands when
studying attentional biases in eye-tracking paradigms in light of these issues.

Conclusions
After reviewing the evidence for attentional biases
in depression, Rinck and Becker (2005, p. 63)
concluded that ‘‘the empirical evidence regarding
attentional biases in depression is scarce and
heterogeneous, making it very difficult to draw
firm conclusions’’. Although the evidence is still far
from unequivocal, researchers have made important advances since Rinck and Becker’s review, and
there is a growing consensus that depression is
associated with attentional biases that may play a
role in the vulnerability and maintenance of the
disorder. Our study has identified a dysphoriarelated bias in the allocation of attention distinct
from that observed in depressed individuals
(Eizenman et al., 2003; Kellough et al., 2008),
and this finding may have important theoretical
and methodological implications for depression
researchers. The other novel result was the identification of a dysphoria-related impairment in the
endogenous disengagement of attention from
depression-related images. Our research demonstrates that eye-tracking methodology offers significant advantages for the study of selective
attention in depressed and dysphoric individuals.
