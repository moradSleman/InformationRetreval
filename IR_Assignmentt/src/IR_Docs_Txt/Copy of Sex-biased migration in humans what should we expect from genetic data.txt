Sex-biased migration in humans:
what should we expect from
genetic data?
Jon F. Wilkins1,3* and Frank W. Marlowe2
Summary
Different patterns of mitochondrial and Y-chromosome
diversity have been cited as evidence of long-term
patrilocality in human populations. However, what patterns are expected depends on the nature of the sampling
scheme. Samples from a local region reveal only the
recent demographic history of that region, whereas
sampling over larger geographic scales accesses older
demographic processes. A historical change in migration
becomes evident first at local geographic scales, and
alters global patterns of genetic diversity only after
sufficient time has passed. Analysis of forager populations in the ethnographic record suggests that patrilocality may not have predominated among pre-agricultural
humans. The higher female migration rate inferred by
some genetic studies may reflect a shift to patrilocality in
association with the emergence of agriculture. A recent
global survey does not show the expected effects of
higher female migration, possibly because the sampling
scheme used for this study is accessing pre-agricultural
human migration patterns. In this paper, we show how the
demographic shift associated with agriculture might
affect genetic diversity over different spatial scales. We
also consider the prospects for studying sex-biased
migration using the X-linked and autosomal markers.
These multi-locus comparisons have the potential of
providing more robust estimates of sex differences than
Y-linked and mitochondrial data, but only if a very large
number of loci are included in the analysis. BioEssays

Introduction
Sex-biased dispersal is found in many animals, including
humans. Current patterns of dispersal can often be studied
through direct observation—by tracking the movements of
individual males and females. Studying dispersal patterns in
the past, however, typically relies on indirect methods, such as
analysis of archaeological or genetic data. In recent years,
genetic methods have been employed in an effort to quantify

the differences between the migration histories of human
males and females. For the most part, these efforts have
focused on two chromosomes: the mitochondria (mtDNA) and
the non-recombining portion of the Y-chromosome (NRY),
which both have special, uni-parental modes of inheritance.
Because the mtDNA is always inherited from the mother, it
reflects the demographic history of females, whereas the
paternally inherited NRY reflects the demographic history of
males.
In 1998, Seielstad and colleagues published the first global
comparison of human mtDNA and NRY diversity.(1) Using a
simple model of geographic structure—and a number of other
simplifying assumptions—this analysis suggested that the
female migration rate was approximately eight times greater
than that for males. The difference was attributed to the
predominance of patrilocality among human cultures: it is far
more common for a wife to move in with her husband’s family,
or into his village, than the other way around. Under
patrilocality, the typical distance between the birthplaces of a
father and his sons is smaller than that between a mother and
her daughters. Over the course of many generations, this
produces systematic differences in the patterns of geographic
diversity on the mtDNA and NRY, which we can observe
today.
Since the publication of the original Seielstad study, a large
number of studies comparing the human mtDNA and NRY
have appeared. Most of these studies have focused on a
particular population or region. In some cases, the results of
these local studies are easily interpreted in terms of local
cultural practices: patrilocal groups show more geographic
structure in their Y-chromosomes, while matrilocal groups
have more geographically structured mitochondria.(2–4) In
other cases, the results reflect known historical events. For
example, colonizations consisting primarily of men have
resulted in the introgression of European Y-chromosomes—
but not mitochondria—into native populations in South
America(5,6) and Greenland.(7)
When this type of comparison has been made at the
global scale, however, the interpretation is not so clear,
and different studies have produced apparently conflicting
results. A global survey published in 2004 by Wilder
and colleagues found no evidence for a higher female
migration rate.(8) These authors attribute the disagreement

to methodological differences—specifically that previous global
results are unreliable due to problems of ascertainment bias.
While we believe that the ascertainment issue is important,
these contradictory conclusions draw attention to a deeper
issue: the assumptions that typically underlie the analysis of
this type of data. It is common to interpret genetic data in terms
of models and statistics that implicitly assume equilibrium—
that is, that the demographic processes going on today are
identical to those that went on in the past. When the population
is not at equilibrium, this leads to bias in the analysis and
sensitivity to factors that are not generally considered very
important, such as the details of the scheme according to which
the genetic samples were collected. In the context of sexbiased human migration, equilibrium implies that the relative
rates of male and female migration have not changed over time,
or that any change occurred so far in the past that it has no
influence on the genetic patterns observed today.
The construction of a non-equilibrium model involves the
incorporation of many additional possible parameters. In
the absence of additional information, it is difficult to determine
the best way to parameterize a complex model, and how to
constrain it in a way that permits meaningful interpretation of
data. In this paper, we address the issue of how to
parameterize a simple non-equilibrium model of sex-biased
migration, and we make predictions, showing how the
departure from equilibrium will affect genetic patterns at the
global scale. In particular, patterns in the ethnographic data
indicate that the transition to agriculture is associated with an
increase in patrilocality. We propose a model in which male and
female migration are similar over most of human history, and
female-biased migration is a recent phenomenon.
Ancient marital residence patterns
Most human cultures are patrilocal,(9) but this has not
necessarily always been the case. Human migration is not
an invariant expression of human biology. Cultural norms are
important in determining human behaviors, including migration, and these norms can change rapidly. One of the most
important cultural changes is the transition from a mobile
forager lifestyle to a sedentary agricultural one. This relatively
recent transition to agriculture (which began no more than
!10000 years ago in most areas, and much more recently in
some) needs to be incorporated into genetic analyses of sexbiased migration.
While it is true that agricultural societies are overwhelmingly patrilocal, the same is not true of non-agricultural
societies. Forager societies in the ethnographic record show a
more balanced pattern of marital residence than agricultural
societies, with matrilocality being nearly as frequent as
patrilocality over the whole course of married life.(10) Among
foragers, it is common for males to do bride-service and live
with their wife’s kin in the early years of marriage, after which
the couple will live with the husband’s kin. Often, couples

change their residence from season to season or year to year,
residing with the husband’s kin at times and the wife’s kin at
others. This multilocal pattern of residence is especially
common among tropical foragers. Furthermore, patterns of
residence and dispersal among foragers are quite different
from those of sedentary agriculturalists and most other
primates. Foragers’ camps change location, and individuals
move in and out of those camps. The fluidity of forager social
groups makes it difficult to say whether males or females are
dispersing from their natal area or natal group.
When societies begin to cultivate crops on a particular
piece of land, it becomes important to defend that land, and to
pass it on to one’s children. In humans, like other mammals,
male reproductive success can vary much more than female
reproductive success. Sons are therefore favored in inheritance of land. Without such a resource, a son may have
difficulty in acquiring wives, and may produce no children,
whereas a daughter’s reproductive opportunities will be less
dependent on her inheriting property and wealth. The bias in
favor of male inheritance of land means that males tend to live
where they were born, while females marry and move
elsewhere. Patrilocality is favored even among nomadic
pastoralists (!88% of pastoralists), because a male who
inherits his father’s herds has more success in acquiring wives,
and because defending herds is probably best accomplished
by keeping related males together.(11) Mobile foragers do not
grow crops or accumulate wealth, nor do they control
resources like herds, so there is no bias towards male
inheritance and patrilocality among these societies.
It is common to take forager populations as a model for preagricultural human societies. The residence patterns of mobile
foragers suggest that human patrilocality may not be an
ancient phenomenon, but rather that the majority of human
history was characterized by similar male and female
migration rates, or possibly even male-biased dispersal.(12)
At least one analysis of non-human primates also argues
against ancient patrilocality (or male philopatry): a comparison
of modern ape species indicated that the last common
ancestor of gorillas, chimps and humans is likely to have had
male-biased dispersal.(13)
The effect of the difference in marital residence between
foragers and agriculturalists has been noted in the genetic data.
Early genetic studies of aboriginal forager (!Kung and pygmy)
populations in Africa revealed more geographic structure in the
mtDNA than in autosomes, in contrast with what was seen
among agricultural (Bantu, European, and East Asian) populations.(12) More recently, comparison of patterns of mtDNA and
NRY variation in sub-saharan African forager and agricultural
populations found that the genetic evidence for patrilocality was
significantly stronger among the agriculturalists.(4,57)
The spread of agriculture is likely to have been associated
with a reduction in male migration, and possibly also an
increase in female migration. Just as the cultural and

geographic variation in marital residence practices can be
seen in the genetic data, we expect that the historical transition
to agriculture, and the associated increase in patrilocality, will
also have left a genetic mark, and that this mark may be
discernible in global patterns of human genetic diversity.
The importance of real geography
Most analyses attempting to compare male and female
demographies have not considered geographically explicit
models. Calculations based simply on FST are implicitly using a
non-geographic, island model of population structure (Box 1).
Models of isolation by distance (Box 2) incorporate a more
realistic notion of geography. The reliance on simple analyses
assumes that a more geographically explicit analysis would
not significantly alter the main conclusions. For populations at
equilibrium, this assumption is often correct. Using an islandmodel formula to analyze isolation-by-distance data introduces significant biases, but will not affect inference of the
relative male and female migration rates, since the biases in
the mtDNA and NRY analyses cancel out.(14)
However, if the relative rates of male and female migration
have changed over time, explicit consideration of geography is
indispensable. A change in migration will alter patterns of
genetic diversity, but the effect on genetic diversity takes time
to develop. Exactly how much time depends on the geographic
size of the region being studied, and on the details of how
sampling locations are distributed. Inferences about human
history are known to be sensitive to the sampling strategy. For
example, the frequency of rare alleles observed in human
genetic data increases with the number of populations or
ethnicities sampled.(15,16) In this paper, we show another
important effect of sampling that arises in a non-equilibrium
context. Specifically, genetic patterns within a particular region
reflect only the recent history of that region. By contrast,
genetic patterns at larger geographic scales reflect more
ancient demographic processes.
Local genetic patterns represent recent
demographic history
Recent work in coalescent theory has shown that, in models of
geographic structure, the long-term coalescent behavior (the
expected shape of the genealogical trees in the distant past) is
nearly independent of the details of the sampling
scheme.(17,18) In models of isolation by distance, the deeper
(older) portions of the genealogy consist of lineages that will
have traversed the habitat multiple times.(19,20) This means
that the information about geographic structure contained in
genealogies is largely limited to the most recent portions of
those genealogies—the tips of the trees. In fact, this recent,
informative portion of genealogies typically represents a very
small proportion of the overall genealogy depth.(21)
A corollary of this observation is that statistics like FST will
be determined predominantly by demographic patterns in the

292

BioEssays 28.3

recent past. This means that changes in migration that
occurred in the distant past will not be detectable in current
genetic patterns, even if those changes occurred more
recently relative to the most recent common ancestor of
the population. For very recent migration change, the
expected value of FST will be influenced by both the old
and new rates. The more recent the change, the more
important the old rate will be. Under the island model, all that
is expected is this gradual replacement of one genetic pattern
by another.
Under models of isolation by distance, more complex
patterns develop during the transition following a change in
migration. As in the island model, a new genetic pattern
gradually replaces the old. However, in a geographically explicit
model, this replacement occurs at different rates, depending on
geographic scale. The degree of genetic differentiation
between two sampling sites depends on the time since the
migration change and the distance between the sites.
Intuitively, the new migration rate will not dominate the data
until enough time has passed for migrants to have traveled
between the two sites. The farther apart the sites are, the longer
this will take. This distance dependence implies that inferences
based on local-scale sampling will apply only to the most recent
history, whereas widely separated samples may be able to
retrieve older migration patterns.
This sensitivity of genetic patterns to recent demography is
evident in patterns of mtDNA and NRY diversity in two sets of
populations among the hill tribes of northern Thailand.(2) Three
matrilocal groups studied showed a trend towards high withingroup NRY diversity (high male migration) and high betweengroup mtDNA divergence (low female migration). Three
patrilocal groups showed the opposite pattern of variation. A
more detailed and quantitative reanalysis of the same data has
revealed a correlation between the genetically inferred rates of
migration and ethnographically observed degrees of rigidity of
marital residence (strict patrilocality versus a less rigid
matrilocality).(3)
All six groups are from the same geographic region and
speak closely related Tibeto-Burman languages. The matrilocal groups include the Lahu, Red Karen, and White Karen; the
patrilocal groups include the Akha and two groups of Lisu. The
relationship among the languages spoken by these six groups
is illustrated in Fig. 1.(22) One of the matrilocal groups (the
Lahu) lies within the linguistic clade of the three patrilocal
groups. Furthermore, divergence of all of the >250 TibetoBurman languages is thought to have occurred within the past
4000 years.(23)
The degree of linguistic similarity and interrelatedness
suggests that differences in marital residence are unlikely to
represent an ancient cultural divergence between these two
sets of populations. Rather, this genetic data illustrates how
local patterns of genetic diversity respond to cultural changes
over a relatively small number of generations.

Figure 1. Linguistic relationships among the hill tribes of Northern Thailand. This partial language tree is based on linguistic relationships
described in the Ethnologue.(22) One of the three matrilocal groups speaks a language that is more closely related to the languages of the
three patrilocal groups than to those of the other matrilocal groups. The Tibeto-Burman language family consists of at least 250
contemporary languages, which are thought to have diverged from a common Tibeto-Burman ancestor within the last 4000 years. Note that
only one or two of many language subfamilies are represented at each node.

Spread of the new genetic signature following a
migration change
In a model where the habitat is continuous, it is common to
describe the migration rate in terms of a dispersal variance, s2.
For example, if we take a mtDNA sample from a woman born at
a particular location, these models describe the birthplace of
the woman’s mother as a bivariate normal (Gaussian)
distribution centered on the sampled woman’s birthplace, with
a variance of s2 in each direction. The term s has units of
distance, and can be thought of as the ‘‘typical’’ distance
between the birthplaces of a parent and its offspring. We are
interested in describing the effect of a change in this migration
rate at a time t generations in the past. We indicate the old
migration rate (more than t generation in the past) as s1, and
the new migration rate (for the most recent t generations)
as s2.
We have simulated the coalescent process in a twodimensional, continuous habitat. The details of this simulation
process have been described elsewhere.(21) The habitat is a
rectangle of dimension 10 " 20 (in arbitrary units) with a
population of uniform density and total haploid size 200,000.
The mean coalescence time (in generations) for a pair of
adjacent samples is t0, and for a pair of samples separated by a
distance x it is tx. Under equilibrium conditions (s1 ¼ s2), and
ignoring boundary effects, the ratio (tx-t0)/t0 (¼FST/(1-FST)) is
expected to increase linearly with Log(x), with a slope that
depends on s24—the higher the value of s, the shallower the
expected slope.
For given values of s and t, there is a characteristic
distance x* defined
qffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiby diffusion under the new migration
scheme: x $ % 2s22 t. For sampling locations separated by a
distance of less than x*, the new migration rate s2 will dominate

the genetic patterns, while differentiation at distances greater
than x* will depend more on the old migration rate. A process
similar to this has been described for a slightly different nonequilibrium model. Following a rapid range expansion, isolation by distance appears gradually, and is evident first over
short distances, and spreads at a similar rate.(25)
We simulated four migration scenarios. Two equilibrium
scenarios assume a migration rate that was constant through
time, with s equal to either 0.05 or 0.15. The other scenarios
feature a reduction in the migration rate. In these nonequilibrium simulations, we set the old dispersal rate, s1 to
0.15, and the new dispersal rate, s2 to 0.05. The transition from
the old rate to the new one occurred either t ¼ 40 or t ¼ 400
generations in the past. Fig. 2 plots the average estimated
value of FST/(1-FST) against as a function of the logarithm of
the distance between sampling sites. For the two equilibrium
simulations, the simulated values (open and closed circles)
are similar to the expected values (solid lines) based on
Rousset’s analysis. For the two non-equilibrium simulations,
we have calculated the critical distance x*, indicated by the two
vertical, dashed lines. At distances shorter than x* the average
estimated FST/(1-FST) increases with distance at the rate
expected under the recent migration rate, s2. At distances
greater than x*, this estimated value increases more slowly, at
the rate expected under the old migration rate, s1.
Is this relevant to human demographic history?
The effect that we are describing is relevant to human genetic
data only if the transition to patrilocality occurred sufficiently
recently for the older migration patterns still to be evident at
some geographic scales. If we date the transition at !10000
years before present and take the average human generation

Figure 2. Spread of the genetic consequences of a change in migration. This graph illustrates how the pattern of isolation by distance
changes under non-equilibrium migration. Under equilibrium migration (constant migration rate), the expected value of FST/(1-FST) between
a pair of sites increases linearly with the natural logarithm of the distance between those sites. The slope is equal to 1/Nb, where Nb is the
neighborhood size. The blue line has the expected slope for s ¼ 0.15 (slope ¼ 0.00707). The red crosses represent the mean estimated

Eurasia is on the order of 10000 km long from east to west. In
order for the pre-agricultural genetic patterns to have been
fully replaced at this geographic scale, the typical migration
distance s2 would need to have been on the order of 360 km
per generation. Marital distance (the distance between the
birthplaces of a husband and wife) in small-scale societies
typically averages less than 100 km, with a mean of around
40 km in forager societies, and less among horticulturalists.(26)
If typical human dispersal has been closer to 30 km per
generation, we should expect to see evidence of preagricultural migration patterns at distances of over 1000 km.
The transition to agriculture occurred at different times in
different regions, and for some populations has never
occurred. There are two obvious ways in which this asynchronous transition might bias our critical-distance estimate. On

294

BioEssays 28.3

one hand, the fact that agriculture arose more recently than
10000 years ago in most locations suggests that this estimate
is too large. On the other hand, the fact that agricultural
societies tend to expand and often displace their nonagricultural neighbors should increase the rate at which the
post-agricultural patterns spread. This heterogeneity could
only be fully accommodated in a complex and geographically
detailed model, but this estimate at least suggests that the
genetic vestiges of our pre-agricultural, multi-local ancestry
may still be identifiable at the largest geographic scales.
FST under different sampling schemes
One consequence of a recent migration change in a model of
isolation by distance is that the behavior of summary statistics
such as FST will depend on the geographic scale over which
samples are taken. To illustrate this effect, we have simulated
datasets under a non-equilibrium migration model similar to
the one proposed here. Datasets were simulated for two loci
(mtDNA and NRY) collected using three different sampling

Problems and paradigms

Figure 3. The effect of sampling distribution on comparisons of FST under a non-equilibrium model of migration. A: illustrates the three
sampling schemes used in simulations whose results are presented in B. The filled diamonds represent the ‘‘local’’ sampling scheme, the
twenty-five crosses represent the ‘‘uniform’’ sampling scheme, and the four open diamonds represent the ‘‘distant’’ sampling scheme.
Simulations assumed a sample of size ten from each site. The specific sampling locations for each lineage were drawn at random from an
area around the site corresponding to regional population of twenty. FST values were estimated by comparing the mean number of pairwise
differences among all pairs of samples and the mean number of differences from all pairs from the same site. The ratio of male to female
migration was estimated assuming an equilibrium island model. Ten thousand datasets were simulated for each value of t, the time at which
the migration pattern changed. The mean estimated ratio of male to female migration is plotted on a log-log scale in B. B: illustrates the
effect on estimates of sex-biased migration of a change in migration at time t generations in the past. Prior to t generations in the past,
migration is assumed to be equal for males and females (smtDNA ¼ sNRY ¼ 0.15). For the most recent t generations, migration is strongly
female biased (sNRY ¼ 0.03; smtDNA ¼ 0.3). For changes in the very distant past (large t), the genetic patterns have nearly equilibrated under
the new migration pattern, and FST values represent this new pattern (FST (male) > FST (female); sNRY > smtDNA) at all sampling scales. At
smaller values of t, however, the population is not at equilibrium, and the relative migration rate inferred from mtDNA and NRY FST estimates
depends strongly on the geographic scale over which samples were collected. Local sampling (green line, filled circles) responds most
quickly to the change in migration. The uniform sampling scheme (red dashed line, filled squares) responds more slowly. The distant
sampling scheme (purple line, stars) responds most slowly, so that patterns observed at this scale are most reflective of the old migration
scheme.

schemes (Fig. 3). For the most recent t generations, the loci
have different dispersal rates: smt2 ¼ 0.3 and sY2 ¼ 0.03. Prior
to t generations in the past, both loci have the same dispersal
rate (smt1 ¼ sy1 ¼ 0.15). An infinite sites model of mutation with
m ¼ 0.001 per locus per generation was assumed. The three
sampling schemes are illustrated in Fig. 3A.
We estimated FST for each simulated mtDNA and NRY
dataset. We then calculated the ratio of female to male
migration that would be inferred from that data under an island
model at equilibrium. The average inferred ratio for each of the
three schemes is plotted in Fig. 3B as a function of t, the time
since the transition. For a change that occurred sufficiently far
in the past (t & 10000), the inferred sex bias in migration is
similar under each of the three sampling schemes. For more
recent changes (smaller values of t), both the old and new

migration patterns influence estimated FST values. In this
transitional period, the recent migration history predominates
when sampling is done on a local scale, whereas ancient
migration patterns are more evident among geographically
distant samples.
The studies
The sampling schemes used for the simulations presented in
Fig. 3 were chosen by rough analogy with the three studies
discussed here in detail. The local sampling scheme, chosen
by analogy to the Thai hill tribes studies(2,3) is most sensitive to
the recent migration history of the population. The other two
sampling schemes were chosen to illustrate the effects on
global patterns. The dense, global sampling scheme, analogous to the Seielstad study(1) is more sensitive to recent

migration patterns than is the geographically sparse scheme,
analogous to the Wilder study.(8) We suggest that a part of the
explanation for the different conclusions reached in these two
studies stems from the difference in sampling schemes. The
denser set of samples used by Seielstad may be more
reflective of post-agricultural, patrilocal marital residence
patterns, whereas the sparser sampling scheme of Wilder
may be accessing the older, multilocal migration patterns of
our forager ancestors. These sampling schemes are illustrated in Fig. 4.
Multi-locus genetics
A major limitation common to all studies focusing solely on
mtDNA and NRY markers is stochastic variability. Because
these molecules are large and non-recombining, it is possible
to reconstruct detailed genealogies for each of them. However,
any single genealogy is typically consistent with a wide range
of possible underlying demographic histories. Distinguishing
among those possible histories requires statistical power
available only from multi-locus data.(27) For example, Wall has
estimated that 50–100 loci will be required to determine
whether archaic human populations (e.g. Neanderthals)
contributed to the modern human gene pool.(28)
Human population genetics is being transformed by our
access to unprecedented quantities of data, and it will soon be
common to base human genetic analyses on global, multilocus datasets. Multi-locus data derived from the HGDPCEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel

296

BioEssays 28.3

(HGDCLP)(29) have been used to study human population
structure.(30,31) Similar analyses have been performed on
populations of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which
colonizes the human stomach lining. Due to H. pylori’s low
rate of transmission and high rates of recombination and
mutation, these data provide information that complements
the results from human genetic data.(32 –34)
The growing availability of multi-locus data may also be
useful for studying sex differences in migration. An autosomal allele is present in males and females with equal
frequency, and therefore experiences an average of the male
and female migration rates. In 2000, Jorde and colleagues
published a study comparing mtDNA and NRY data with
autosomal markers.(35) These authors interpret their results
as being broadly consistent with the results of the Seielstad
study.
The Jorde study considers the global patterns in more
detail, however, and raises questions about heterogeneities
among different geographic regions. Microsatellite diversity on
the NRY is markedly reduced in two European populations
(northern Europeans and Finns), which also show extremely
high levels of divergence from other European populations.
This pattern suggests a relatively recent regional bottleneck,
possibly associated with migration into the region or regional
selection. These results point to the importance of using
models that permit geographic variation in demographic
parameters, in addition to the type of temporal variation that
we have focused on here.

Problems and paradigms

The other promising source of multi-locus data for studying
sex-biased migration is the X chromosome. An X-linked allele
is found in a female twice as often as in a male, and its effective
migration rate is a weighted average of male (1/3) and female
(2/3) migration. The different inheritance patterns of X-linked
and autosomal loci mean that sex differences in demography
will produce differences in the patterns of autosomal and
X-chromosome diversity. Studies using X-linked loci to study
human history have recently been reviewed by Schaffner.(36)
Two of these studies have compared X-linked and autosomal patterns of diversity in global samples. Wilson and
colleagues(37) used the program STRUCTURE(38) to assign
354 individuals to genetic clusters on the basis of 23 X-linked or
23 autosomal microsatellite loci. They found better correlation
of this assignment with geographic origin for autosomes than
for X-linked loci, and suggested that this might reflect a higher
female migration rate. By contrast, when Ramachandran and
colleagues(31) performed a similar analysis on 20 of each type
of locus for 1056 individuals, they found no significant difference
in the ability to identify geographic clusters, suggesting an
absence of evidence for large differences between male and
female demographic parameters (such as migration).
The apparent contradiction between these two studies is
reminiscent of the conflicting conclusions of Seielstad and
Wilder. As with those studies, the Wilson and Ramachandran
studies are based on different geographic sampling schemes.
However, the schemes are not qualitatively different in the way
that the schemes of Seielstad and Wilder are, and an analogous
attempt to reconcile these results would require the construction
of a much more geographically and historically explicit model.
There is also the question of which among these results, if any,
need to be reconciled. That is, when is it likely that differing
results simply reflect stochastic variation, and when is it likely
that they represent real differences that need to be accounted
for? We believe that it is worthwhile to consider briefly how
robust comparisons of X-linked and autosomal markers are to
this variation. In particular, how does this compare to the
robustness of a comparison of mtDNA and NRY markers?
How much power is in an X versus
autosome comparison?
Because the X-chromosomes and autosomes both average
over male and female histories, any single X versus autosome
(X/A) comparison has less discriminatory power than the
mtDNA versus NRY (mt/Y) comparison. However, this limitation may be outweighed by the additional power that comes
from using multiple loci. This tradeoff raises the question of just
how much is gained by using multi-locus data. For the specific
case of sex-biased migration, we can do a rough calculation of
the relative power of X/A and mt/Y comparisons. Suppose that
the real male and female migration rates are mm and mf,
respectively, and that NRY and mtDNA analyses produce
unbiased estimates of these migration rates. If we assume that

the variance associated with each of these estimates is the
same (smt2 ¼ sy2 ¼ smt/Y2), the power to detect a migration
difference will be determined roughly by this signal-to-noise
ratio:
jmf ' mm j 0:5jmf ' mm j
¼
:
smt þ sY
smt=Y

ð1Þ

Analysis of an autosomal locus estimates (mm þ mf)/2,
while an X-linked locus estimates (mm þ 2mf)/3. Assume the
variance of each of these estimates is (sx2 ¼ sA2 ¼ sX/A2), so
that the variance of the estimate from n independent loci is
approximately sX/A2/n. The corresponding power of an X/A
comparison is then:
jmf ' mm j=6
:
psffiXffiffiffi þ psffiAffiffiffi
nX
nA

ð2Þ

For example, the full study by Ramachandran,(31) analyzed
20 X-linked and 377 autosomal microsatellite loci (nX ¼ 20,
nA ¼ 377). For this study, equation 2 reduces to:
0:6jmf ' mm j
:
sX =A

ð3Þ

This means that this X/A comparison would be roughly 20
percent more powerful than a traditional mt/Y comparison,
if each individual locus were equally informative (if smt/Y ¼
sX/A)—that is, 20 percent better than a comparison of a single
mtDNA microsatellite with a single Y-chromosome microsatellite. In practice, mtDNA and NRY genetic data will be
significantly more informative than a single microsatellite
(sX/A + smt/Y).
For the subanalyses by Wilson(37) and Ramachandran(31)
comparing equal numbers of X-linked and autosomal microsatellites (23 for Wilson and 20 for Ramachandran), the power
of this comparison is even less than for a single mt/Y
microsatellite comparison:
0:4jmf ' mm j
0:37jmf ' mm j
for 23 loci; or
for 20 loci:
sX =A
sX =A

ð4Þ

Studies like this will become more powerful as the number
of loci—particularly the number of X-linked loci—incorporated
into analyses increases. The X-chromosome is a potential
source of hundreds of informative loci, so it is only a matter of
time before these comparisons begin to outperform the mt/Y
comparison. However, at present, mt/Y studies represent a
more reliable source of information on sex differences than X/
A studies. Despite their use of multi-locus data, the conflicting
results of Wilson and Ramachandran are actually more likely
to reflect stochastic variation than are the conflicting results of
Seielstad and Wilder. The major caveat regarding this
calculation is the assumption that estimates based on the
mtDNA and NRY are unbiased. Because these two chromosomes contain multiple linked genes, they may have been
more strongly shaped by selection than the X-linked and

Problems and paradigms

Box 1: Geographic structure and FST
Geographic patterns of genetic diversity are shaped, in part, by the demographic history of the population: the population’s
size and range, as well as its patterns of reproduction and migration over time. Intuitively, we expect two individuals sampled
from nearby locations to be genetically more similar to each other than individuals sampled from two geographically distant
locations. When migration rates are high, populations are genetically well mixed, and the correlation between genetic
distance and geographic distance is modest. When migration rates are low, local genetic drift results in the accumulation of
genetic differences between different regions.
The formalization of this intuition into quantitative models has a long history in population genetics. The most commonly
used statistics in assessing geographic structure from genetic data are estimators of FST. The ‘‘F-statistics’’ were originally
developed by Sewall Wright to describe the reduction in heterozygosity resulting from inbreeding.(41) In the context of
structured populations, FST is a measure of how genetically similar samples drawn from the same location are, compared
with the genetic diversity of the population as a whole. Low FST values (close to zero) indicate a relatively homogeneous
population, while high FST values (approaching one) indicate strong genetic divergence among subgroups.
In recent decades, population geneticists have tended to think of FST in slightly different terms. These inbreeding
coefficients have been related to more contemporary concepts in population genetics, such as the average time to the most
recent common ancestor of a pair of alleles at a locus.(42) A number of estimators of FST have been developed.(43 –46) These
differ in their details, but the basic principle is to compare genetic diversity within demes to genetic diversity between demes,
or within the population as a whole. An appealing feature of these statistics is that they are based on a ratio of measures of
diversity, and therefore do not depend on the mutation rate (at least in the limit where the mutation rate is small).
The quantity most famously associated with FST is 1/(1 þ 4Nm), where N is the size of each subpopulation, or deme, and
m is the per-generation probability of migration.(47 –49) This is the expected value of FST for autosomes in a diploid population
at equilibrium under the symmetric island model of population subdivision.(48,50) For the NRY and mtDNA, the expected
values of FST depends on the male and female effective population sizes and migration rates, respectively: E[FST (NRY)] ¼ 1/
(1 þ 2Nmmm); E[FST (mtDNA)] ¼ 1/(1 þ 2Nfmf). Assuming equal effective population sizes for males and females (Nm ¼ Nf),
these equations produced the original estimate of eight-fold higher female migration.(1)

autosomal microsatellites, in which case, the X/A comparison,
while less powerful, would more accurately reflect the purely
demographic aspects of human history.
Effective population size
The other demographic parameter that we have mentioned at
several points, but not considered explicitly, is the effective

population size. Standard population genetic methods do not
provide a direct estimate of migration, but rather an estimate
of the product of the migration rate m and the effective
population size Ne (see Box 1). The original estimate by
Seielstad relied on the argument that the male and female
effective population sizes are unlikely to be dramatically
different in humans.

Box 2: Isolation by distance
Under the assumptions of the island model, a migrant entering one subpopulation, or deme, is equally likely to have come
from any of the other demes. In some sense, this is a model of population structure without geography. In many
circumstances, we expect that migrants will derive preferentially from nearby demes. In this case, the expected genetic
divergence between subgroups will increase with the geographic distance between them, a phenomenon known as isolation
by distance.(51,52) The theory of isolation by distance has been developed both in the context of continuous populations and
the ‘‘stepping-stone’’ model of population structure.(53 –56)
Methods have also developed to estimate dispersal from pairwise FST estimates.(24,25) In these methods, FST (or some
function of FST) is estimated for each pair of locations where samples were collected. The rate at which this scaled genetic
divergence increases with the distance between the two locations is used to estimate the rate of gene flow. For instance, in
the method of Rousset,(24) the quantity FST/(1-FST) for each pair of sites is plotted against either the distance between those
sites (in one dimension), or the logarithm of the distance between sites (in two dimensions). The reciprocal of the resulting
slope provides an estimator of the neighborhood size (4ps2r, where r is the population density, and s2 is the variance of
dispersal profile). Roughly speaking, this is the number of individuals within the range of a single generation of migration.

Problems and paradigms

The simulation results presented here also assume equal
male and female effective population sizes, and focus on
chromosomes with the same nominal value of Ne under this
assumption. The larger effective population sizes of X-linked
and autosomal loci suggest that these genes might reflect
older demographic processes than the mtDNA and NRY,
although we have not explicitly modeled that effect here. A
more-thorough analysis would also incorporate the possibility
of different male and female values of Ne, and that the
magnitude of this difference may have varied over time like
the ratio of migration rates. The higher variance of male
reproductive success is expected to translate into a reduced
male effective population size. If cultural transitions, like the
adoption of agriculture, are systematically associated with a
change in the distribution of reproductive success, this effect
could produce changes similar to those described here for a
change in the migration rate. The genetic consequences of a
change in Ne would propagate spatially in a manner similar to
the propagation illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 for a change in
migration.
Some recent studies have attempted to compare the value
of Ne for males and females. In a paper published around the
same time as their study of male and female migration, Wilder
and colleagues provided evidence that Ne is systematically
greater for females than for males.(39) The Ramachandran
study comparing X-linked and autosomal markers actually
found evidence for Ne being lower for females than for males.
Comparison of these results is difficult because the analytic
methods are so different. The Wilder study used coalescent
simulations to examine a number of bottleneck and selective
sweep scenarios, whereas the Ramachandran study focused
on a model of divergence with constant effective population
size. A recent paper attempting to incorporate cultural change in
this context argues that NRYpatterns suggest a recent increase
in Ne for males, possibly reflecting a shift from polygyny to
monogamy.(40) As in the case of migration, we believe that
explicit consideration of this type of cultural change is an
indispensable part of studies of human genetics, and that
basing analyses on more realistic models may help to resolve
apparent discrepancies among different studies.
Conclusion
Humans are unusual in that many of the demographic factors
shaping our genetic diversity (e.g. patterns of migration and
reproduction) depend strongly on cultural practices. These
practices can change on a timescale that is short relative to
depth of human gene trees. One challenge facing researchers
in this area is how to incorporate some of the complexities that
we know are important to human history, but without
introducing so many parameters that the models over-fit the
data or become uninterpretable. For the specific case of
human migration, we have shown how knowledge from other
fields can be used to sensibly construct a more realistic

method for analyzing human genetic data. Patterns in the
ethnographic record identify the adoption of agriculture as a
major transition point for sex differences in human migration.
In order to make the best use of the emerging wealth of
genetic data, methods of analysis need to be developed that
are robust to the complexities of human demographic history.
We have discussed just one of many cultural phenomena that
are likely to have influenced patterns of human genetic
diversity. Consideration of at least some non-equilibrium
demographic processes will likely be required for us to
meaningfully interpret data. This will require the development
of new models and analytic tools as well as a continued
dialogue between human molecular genetics and the social
sciences, whose observations can inform more sophisticated
analyses of human genetic data.
