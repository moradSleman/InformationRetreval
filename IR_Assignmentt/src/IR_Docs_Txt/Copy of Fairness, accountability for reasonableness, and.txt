Abstract
Fairness is a key goal of priority setting and ‘accountability for reasonableness’ has
emerged as the leading framework for fair priority setting. However, it has not been shown
acceptable to those engaged in priority setting. In particular, since it was developed in the
context of a primarily privately funded health system, its applicability in a primarily publicly
funded system is uncertain. In this paper, we describe elements of fairness identified by
decision-makers engaged in priority setting for new technologies in Canada (a primarily
publicly funded system). According to these decision makers, accountability for reasonableness is acceptable and applicable. Our findings also provide refinements to accountability for
reasonableness. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
As resources are limited, both private (e.g. managed care organizations) and
public (e.g. Ministry of Health) health care organizations set priorities regarding
which health care services will and will not be funded. A goal of priority setting is

fairness: when does a patient or clinician have sufficient reason to accept as fair
particular priority setting decisions [1]? Fairness has been addressed in theoretical
analyses of priority setting [2–6]. Daniels and Sabin’s framework for fair priority
setting in health care institutions, accountability for reasonableness [1,7], is gaining
attention internationally [8].
According to accountability for reasonableness, health care institutions engaged
in priority setting have a claim to fairness if they satisfy four conditions [1,7]:
1. rationales for priority setting decisions must be publicly accessible (publicity
condition);
2. these rationales must be considered by fair-minded people to be relevant to
priority setting in that context (rele6ance condition);
3. there must be an avenue for appealing these decisions and their rationales
(appeals condition);
4. there must be some means, either voluntary or regulatory, of ensuring that the
first three conditions are met (enforcement condition).
Accountability for reasonableness provides a framework by which the fairness of
priority setting in health care can be evaluated [9,10]. Although derived in part
from empirical studies of managed care organizations, no one has examined its
applicability to actual priority setting contexts. Moreover, it was developed in the
US, a primarily privately funded health care system. Its applicability in a primarily
publicly funded health system (e.g. Canada, UK) has not been examined.
Therefore, it is necessary to examine whether the conditions of fair priority
setting described in accountability for reasonableness are familiar and acceptable to
decision makers involved in priority setting. If these ideas were alien, or worse,
unacceptable to them, it would be unlikely that accountability for reasonableness
could be adopted or applied.
In this paper, we will report elements of fairness described by decision-makers
engaged in priority setting in health technology assessment for cancer and cardiac
care in Canada, and compare them to the four conditions of accountability for
reasonableness. Our analysis explores the applicability of accountability for reasonableness in actual priority setting and also yields details that can help refine its four
conditions.

2. Methods
We conducted a qualitative study involving in-depth, open-ended interviews with
members of two committees engaged in priority setting for new technologies in
cancer and cardiac care [11,12]. We focussed on the Cancer Care Ontario Policy
Advisory Committee for the New Drug Funding Program and the Cardiac Care
Network of Ontario Expert Panel on Intracoronary Stents and Abciximab (a
glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor). The Cancer Care Ontario Policy Advisory Committee ‘‘manage[s] the selection and introduction of all new drugs within the funds
provided’’. [13]. The Cardiac Care Network of Ontario Expert Panel on Intracoronary Stents and Abciximab was mandated to ‘‘review current literature and

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

281

practice… and recommend, where possible, a cost-effective, multi-year plan for
stent volumes and use of Abciximab that supports the principles of quality of
care, access and affordability’’.[14]
We invited all members of both committees to participate. Of the 26-committee members, 21 were interviewed (11 of 15 from CCO and 10 of 11 from
CCN). Two refused to be interviewed because they resigned from the committee
due to scheduling conflicts; three did not respond.
The interviews were semi-structured; the interviewer asked open-ended questions, pursued emerging themes, and sought clarification. Participants were asked
to describe their role on the committee, describe the committee process, comment on whether they thought the committee’s process and decisions were ‘fair’
and indicate the criteria on which their answers were based, and describe how
fairness could be improved. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analyzed. The interview transcripts were read and participants’ views regarding fairness in priority setting were identified. These units of text were underlined and
descriptive notes were written in the margins of the transcripts; this process is
referred to as coding. Coded units were then labeled as specific concepts relating
to fairness. For example, units that related to the concepts of multiple disciplines, content expertise and different perspectives were identified. Labeled units
were then compared within and between interviews. Similar concepts were
grouped together under one overarching theme label (e.g. multiple perspectives),
and the data were recorded by theme. The themes were organized according to
perceived importance, which was based on both prevalence and the participants’
emphasis. Finally, descriptions of the themes were developed using the participants’ own words. The findings were presented to the chairs of the two committees as a ‘member check’ to corroborate our interpretations.
This study was approved by the Committee on Use of Human Subjects of the
University of Toronto. All participants provided consent for the interview.

3. Elements of fairness according to decision makers
The decision-makers we interviewed described two general and 11 specific
elements of fairness. These elements are described below and summarized in the
second column of Table 1.

3.1. Two general elements of fairness
According to the decision-makers in our study, fair priority setting depends on
a fair priority setting process. When asked if the committee decisions were fair,
many participants said, ‘‘I have no way of knowing that’’. They claimed not to
know of criteria for determining fair outcomes. On the other hand, they claimed
to know at least some criteria for determining whether the process was fair.

282

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

‘‘I don’t think there’s such a thing as a right or wrong decision, or right or wrong
answers. I don’t think you can judge what we’re doing based on the outcomes.
It’s more of a process.’’

The decision-makers we interviewed also believed that fairness is relati6e; that is,
it is not an ‘all-or-none’ concept but, rather, a matter of degree. They identified 11
specific elements of fairness in priority setting. As the fairness of each element is
improved, so is the overall fairness of priority setting decisions.

3.2. Ele6en specific elements of fairness (see Table 1)
According to the decision-makers in our study, the priority setting process should
be characterized by both internal and external transparency. Internal transparency
means that all members know the issue being considered and the content of the
deliberations. External transparency means that the processes, deliberations, decisions and reasoning of the decision making body are made available to stakeholders
external to the membership.
‘‘I believe the process that we’ve used, at least within the group, has been quite
transparent. Whether it’s transparent externally, I don’t think so yet. I do not
think we have anything to be ashamed of, and I think if anybody looked at what
we’ve done, given the fact that we’re human beings and we don’t agree on
[everything], I don’t think they’re major problems. But I think that we need to
develop the tools to allow people externally to have a better idea of how we make
decisions.’’

According to the decision-makers in our study, including representatives from
multiple perspecti6es was the single most important element of fair priority setting.
Appropriate combinations of lay and expert members who represent different
stakeholder groups can bring to the surface a variety of issues, values and
perspectives.
‘‘It brings people of various backgrounds together and different skills and
different perspectives, and if that group can come together and reach a decision
I think it’s a reasonable decision. It’s not as though one or two people were
coming together and making a decision from a very limited background and
experience and perspective.’’

For example, a physician may be able to describe the clinical benefits and harms
of a particular treatment, but a patient can best describe the treatment’s personal
impact.
‘‘The view of the professional treating the patient may be quite different from the
view of the patient and I think that that other kind of input is really critical to
the acceptance of the kinds of decisions that are being made.’’

They also stated that, to ensure that all relevant information and perspectives are
considered, it may be necessary to seek external consultation from people who are
not members of the committee. This input can supplement that of the members.
‘‘Where we saw that disease site groups were making recommendations that
might or might not be approved by the committee, we made a special effort to
invite disease sector chairs to address the committee, often in person, to tell us
about the recommendation, to ask questions.’’

The decision-makers we interviewed felt that decision-making bodies should try
to reach consensus. That is, everyone should either agree with the decision, or be
satisfied that the decision was well considered and is acceptable.
‘‘It’s not done by an individual, it’s done by a group, which gives it more
credence.’’
‘‘Well I think the fairness of the process is that everybody reads over the
recommendations. They are criticized. They are reviewed by all of the panel
members. And then the best assessment that is possible— consensus— is put
forward as the recommendation.’’

284

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

They felt that committee members’ participation should be characterized by
honesty. Members should contribute all relevant factual information, do it accurately, and contribute perspectives that truly represent what they purport (i.e. no
‘hidden agendas’).
‘‘I think we’ve been able to get good honest input from a number of disciplines
and that has gone a long way to trying to make the process fair.’’

They also felt that each member must identify potential conflicts of interest.
‘‘There’s always lurking in the background that conflict of interest, and that
perception that, when you get a group of physicians together that are totally
interested in this area, you wonder if, from their perspective, you’re getting really
the most balanced point of view.’’

The decision-makers we interviewed stated that stakeholders dissatisfied with a
particular decision, or the decision making process, should have access to an
appeals mechanism.
‘‘Another thing we have to work out is this whole appeals mechanism too. ’Cause
it can’t just be who talks the longest and the loudest… There’s got to be some
process for deciding what gets reconsidered.’’

These decision-makers claimed that committee leadership also contributed to
perceptions of fairness. Committee chairs usually participate in the selection of
members and guide the flow of discussion. According to the participants, a
commitment to fairness requires that the leader ensure that all committee members,
especially where experts and non-experts are members, can participate and all issues
and perspectives are considered.
‘‘It was fair because I think [the chair] did a very good job in making sure pros
and cons were brought to the table. Although he is at the forefront of the use of
[technology], he was also cautious and he wasn’t overzealous in his approach. So
I think that the way that he was able to give enough airtime to all of the issues
ensured that the process was fair.’’

They also argued that the committee members’ participation should reflect a high
level of understanding regarding pertinent information. In order to ensure that
members have opportunity to achieve sufficient understanding, the chair may have
to intervene to ask for repetition or clarification

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

285

‘‘I think part of [the chair’s] job is to make sure that everybody understands a
reasonable amount of the content of the discussion. The specialists can drift off
… it’s sometimes important for [the chair] to back people back a little bit and
ensure that the statements made about a specific drug or specific condition are
rephrased in terms that everyone understands, and also, but probably more
importantly, that they’re phrasing in the same kind of terminology that was used
when we discussed the previous drug or the previous condition.’’

According to the decision-makers in our study, to achieve fairness, all members
should have an opportunity to express 6iews and be listened to with respect.
‘‘You don’t want the person who has the most expertise to shut up. And yet, you
don’t want the committee to be overinfluenced by, quote, an expert, who happens
to be on the committee.’’

They also thought that agenda setting (presentations, topics, and decisions that
are formally scheduled for committee meetings) should be undertaken with the
same commitment to fairness as all the chair’s duties. Moreover, all members
should have the opportunity to influence agenda setting.
‘‘But I think it’s really critical that the committee not be seen to favor any
particular group or that access be better for any set of people— and I guess that’s
another role for the chair.’’
‘‘There was ample time for members of the panel to take exception or to change
the course or to add new things to the agenda.’’

4. Comparing decision makers views with accountability for reasonableness
In this section we will compare the description of fair priority setting derived
from decision-makers with the conditions of accountability for reasonableness. We
will identify aspects of the decision makers description that helps to refine accountability for reasonableness’ four conditions. (Publicity, Rele6ance, Appeals, Enforcement— described below). (see Table 1).

4.1. Publicity
According to the publicity condition of accountability for reasonableness, making priority-setting decisions and their rationales publicly accessible enables wider
public deliberation regarding the principles upon which limit setting decisions are

286

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

made. Engaging stakeholders in public deliberation about tough limit setting
decisions demonstrates respect for the moral diversity of those affected[15]. In
addition, as each successive decision and its rationales are submitted for public
scrutiny, a type of ‘case law’ begins to develop which helps to ensure decision-making consistency.
The decision-makers we interviewed supported this idea by arguing that fairness
is not an ‘all-or-nothing’ concept, but that fairness is relative and, therefore, could
be improved. In addition, they proposed a concept they called transparency, which
had two parts: internal and external. Internal refers to transparency within the
committee, among committee members. External refers to transparency outside the
committee, meaning publicly. Their concept of external transparency is the same as
the publicity condition of accountability for reasonableness. Distinguishing between
the concepts of external and internal transparency is a refinement to accountability
for reasonableness.

4.2. Rele6ance
According to the relevance condition of accountability for reasonableness, rationales for priority setting decisions should be ‘reasonable’, that is they should appeal
to values and principles that ‘fair-minded’ people can agree are relevant to limit
setting in each context. People are fair-minded if they are committed to co-operating and considering the common good.
The decision-makers we interviewed considered that having a wide range of
individuals involved was the key to fairness. In their view, which closely corresponds to the relevance condition, including multiple perspectives ensures that a
wide range of relevant values and principles are considered in decision-making.
Similarly, when one or more relevant perspectives appear to be missing, seeking
external consultation fills that void. They also provided two refinements to the
relevance condition. First, they expanded on the concepts of mutual Cupertino and
agreement by indicating that the ‘method’ of fair decision making should be
consensus and not majority or elite rule. They also sharpened the notion of
‘fair-minded’ people by suggesting that decision-makers in fair priority setting
should participate honestly and should identify any potential conflicts of interest.
These may be thought of as ‘tests’ or ‘checks’ on fair-mindedness.

4.3. Appeals
According to the appeals condition of accountability for reasonableness, an
appeals mechanism is necessary for two reasons. First, it shows respect for those
who disagree with a particular decision and provides them with a way of engaging
with decision makers in a dispute resolution procedure designed to prevent or
de-escalate conflict. Second, it contributes to the public deliberation and, therefore,
to the growing case law of priority setting decisions.
The decision-makers we interviewed supported this condition but provided no
substantial refinements.

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

287

4.4. Enforcement
According to the enforcement condition of accountability for reasonableness,
enforcement is necessary to ensure that the first three conditions (publicity, rele6ance, appeals), which are process-oriented conditions, are met. Enforcement may
be either voluntary or, if voluntary enforcement fails to ensure that the three
process conditions are met, regulatory.
The decision-makers we interviewed supported the necessity of enforcement by
emphasizing that fairness requires fair processes. They also provided refinements to
the concept of voluntary enforcement by proposing several elements of fairness that
contribute to ensuring that fair process is followed. These elements include:
leadership that helps to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to express their
views, that everyone understands the nature of the decision and the considerations
under discussion, and that the process is transparent to all the decision makers (this
is the internal part of transparency mentioned above), including ensuring transparent and accessible agenda setting. These may be thought of a ‘check’ on voluntary
enforcement. The decision-makers in our study did not comment on regulatory
enforcement.

5. Implications
Fairness is a goal of priority setting. It has been recognized that health care
institutions wishing to achieve fair priority setting must follow a fair process
[7 –9,16–19]. Moreover, by focusing explicitly on fair process, health care institutions can enhance public confidence in particular priority setting decisions [20].
Accountability for reasonableness has emerged as an important model of fair
process. However, it has not previously been examined from the standpoint of
decision-makers engaged in priority setting.
The decision-makers in our study confirmed the idea that fairness entails fair
process. They also identified two general— fairness equals fair process, and fairness
not all or none, but relati6e —and 11 specific elements of fairness in priority setting,
some of which have been described previously— seeking multiple perspecti6es [21],
establishing leadership [22], creating an opportunity to express 6iews [23], ensuring
honesty, seeking external consultation, establishing understanding [24], ensuring
transparency [25,26], achieving consensus [18,20], identifying potential conflicts of
interest, agenda setting, and creating an appeals mechanism [15]. Issues related to
potential conflicts of interest have been described, but not with regard to priority
setting [27]. Elements that are new include honesty, external consultation, and
agenda setting. We integrate these elements of fairness in priority setting in an
evidence-based framework that reflects the decision-makers’ perspective.
Accountability for reasonableness is a process-oriented framework that specifies
four conditions (publicity, rele6ance, appeals, enforcement) for fair priority setting.
Each condition is familiar and acceptable to the participants— and, all four
conditions can be inferred by at least one element of fairness described by the

288

D.K. Martin et al. / Health Policy 61 (2002) 279–290

decision-makers. In particular, the decision-makers in our study highlighted the
involvement of multiple perspectives as the key specific element of fairness in
priority setting. Accountability for reasonableness encourages broad stakeholder
involvement. An important next step is to find creative ways of making that work
to achieve the goal of fairness. In addition, the elements of fairness described by
decision-makers provide more details that help to refine the four conditions of
accountability for reasonableness. The refinements include: distinguishing between
the concepts of internal and external transparency; external consultation to supplement committee membership; consensus as method of agreement; honesty and
identifying potential conflicts of interest as ‘tests’ of ‘fair-mindedness; and five
elements that flesh out the concept of voluntary enforcement (leadership, internal
transparency, understanding, opportunity to express 6iews, agenda setting). The
decision-makers in our study did not identify any elements of fairness that conflict
with or are missing from accountability for reasonableness. Moreover, the decisionmakers in our study were operating within a primarily publicly funded health care
system (i.e. Canada). This provides evidence that the conditions of accountability
for reasonableness are familiar and acceptable within that context.
Our study had two main limitations. First, this description of fairness, and the
focus on fair process, was developed in the context of two provincial disease
management organizations making decisions regarding new technologies in cancer
and cardiac care. It may not be fully generalizable to priority setting in other
contexts such as governments, regional health authorities, hospitals, or hospital
programs. However, since fairness is a common goal across contexts and since all
contexts must deal with priority setting for new technologies, it is likely that some
of the concepts will be generalizable. Second, what participants said they did (or
ought to have done) may not be what they really did; there is a difference between
portraying and conducting a fair process.
In conclusion, accountability for reasonableness is a framework for fair priority
setting that is familiar and acceptable to decision makers in the study context. In
addition, the perspective of decision-makers in our study provides refinements to
accountability for reasonableness’ four condition. Moreover, our study was conducted in a primarily publicly funded health care system (i.e. Canada) and,
therefore, provides evidence that it is applicable here as well as in a primarily
privately funded system. Future intervention research should attempt to apply the
conditions of accountability for reasonableness in health care institutions in order
to improve (i.e. make fair) priority setting priority setting in health care.
