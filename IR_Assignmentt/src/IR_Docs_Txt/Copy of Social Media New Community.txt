ABSTRACT

in an effort to appeal to conservative viewers.1 Exposure
to biases in news reporting has numerous consequences. It
has been shown to have the capability to foster intolerance
as well as ideological segregation, and even antagonisms in
major political and social issues [8]. Bias can also affect
voting behavior, depending on the degree and direction of
it, and on voters’ reliance on media [6, 10]. Being aware,
tracking, and overcoming bias in news reporting is important
for a fair society, as media indeed has the power to shape a
democratic society.
Twitter is a major component of the online news ecosystem. Once passive, users consuming news online filter news
and discuss what media publish on Twitter. Social media
can play a major role in terms of overcoming biases, since
social media users can freely (in principle) report on current
events showing other angles of a story, and also help us understand the presence of bias in the news online ecosystem.
In this paper, we focus on the latter.
Bias can happen in a number of ways [19]: which stories
are selected, selection bias, how much attention is given to a
story, coverage bias, and how a story is reported, statement
bias. We analyze data from dozens of international news
media organizations to answer how can we quantify biases in
online news? Naturally, we do not expect that media bias
can be reduced to a single quantity or metric. Therefore,
for each type of bias, we introduce a set of metrics that
capture different aspects of it. Our main contributions are
the following:

We examine biases in online news sources and social media communities around them. To that end, we introduce
unsupervised methods considering three types of biases: selection or “gatekeeping” bias, coverage bias, and statement
bias, characterizing each one through a series of metrics.
Our results, obtained by analyzing 80 international news
sources during a two-week period, show that biases are subtle but observable, and follow geographical boundaries more
closely than political ones. We also demonstrate how these
biases are to some extent amplified by social media.

INTRODUCTION

What is published by the news media depends on numerous factors, an important one being the newsworthiness of
a story, but also factors such a space constraint, timeliness,
and how close a story is to readers in a geographical and cultural sense [7]. Since it is impossible to report everything,
selectivity is inevitable. Nonetheless, reputable news media
are expected to be objective in which stories they report and
how they report them; their role is to inform people about
what is happening either locally, nationally or worldwide.
It is however known that media bias exists. For instance,
Fox News has been formally accused of misrepresenting facts

• We introduce unsupervised methods to characterize
biases in online news media and in their communities
in social media.
• We demonstrate multiple metrics that capture geographical and political biases in a large sample of international news media.
• We describe how, in some cases, biases in social media
are amplified with respect to traditional news sources.

DEFINITIONS

This section introduces the concepts we use in this paper.
We start with three definitions.
News article. An online news article or simply “article”
is any document with a publicly-accessible URL, posted on
one of the news websites we follow.

broadcasting.ofcom

Wikipedia.4 We discarded news aggregators (e.g., Yahoo!
News) and websites that do not belong to traditional news
organizations (e.g., Reddit, The Onion, and PR Web).
Next we determined the RSS feed for each news source,
when available, and their corporate Twitter account(s). A
news website may have more than one corporate Twitter
account. For the cases where they correspond to different
sections of the site (e.g., @BBCWorld and @BBCBusiness), we
considered each account as a separate news source. For the
cases where one account links to a subset of the news posted
from a second account (e.g., @AJELive and @AJEnglish), we
merged them.
During a period of two weeks in April 2013, we checked
each source every 30 minutes for new articles. We considered
URLs appearing in the RSS feed (when present), or posted
through a corporate Twitter account. After downloading,
we removed the ancillary elements of each page (common
headers, footers, navigational elements, etc.) using a service5 that applies an heuristic based on tag-to-text ratio.
Finally, named entities where extracted using Open Calais.6

News story. An online news story or simply “story” is
a collection of several articles that are strongly related to a
seminal event [15], e.g. “Death of former UK PM Thatcher”.
Entity. We focus on people mentioned in the news, i.e.
named entities of type person appearing in the content of
news articles or Twitter messages. This typically includes
politicians, athletes, and artists, among many others.

2.1

Bias

Bias is offering a partial perspective on facts [18]. The
degree to which bias is present on a text is often subject
of considerable debate. We consider three types of bias,
following the work by [5]:
Selection bias or gatekeeping. In partisan politics, the
preference for selecting stories from one party. We observe
selection bias by determining which media/community covers a certain story or person.
Coverage bias. In partisan politics, the preference for
giving a larger amount of coverage (time/space) to stories
about one party. We observe coverage bias by looking at the
amount of attention each story or person is given.

3.2

Statement bias. In partisan politics, the preference for
expressing more favorable (or more disfavorable) statements
for one party. We observe statement bias by looking at the
sentiments in statements mentioning different people.

2.2

Social media news communities

All of the news sources we study have a community of
social media users who follows and reposts their stories in
social media. There are at least two ways in which these
communities can be understood. On one hand, social media
communities can be considered a type of “fan” of the news
source. On the other hand, some community members can
also be considered as part of the interpretive community of
news [24], as they are becoming more accustomed to participate actively on the news process (e.g., discovering new
stories or placing them into context).
Both interpretations agree that some users will be more
active than others and motivate our next definition. We
define the active social media community of an online news
source (or “community” in the rest of this paper), as the
set of users who are regularly exposed to articles from that
source (most days of the week for instance), are interested
in sharing those articles, and are active in social media. In
the next section we operationalize this definition.

3.

3.3

Determining social media communities

The active social media community of a news source should
include people who are likely to read the news source almost
every day, and who frequently share on Twitter articles from
that source. For each article from a news source, we collected
the usernames of all Twitter users who posted that URL7 on
Twitter in the first 12 hours after the article’s publication.
A recent study [11] showed that almost all shares of news
articles happen during this period. To avoid automatic accounts (bots) we blacklisted all users posting more than 10
articles from a single source within a day.8 Twitter’s API
allows to obtain up to 1,500 tweets for each URL, which was
enough for all the articles in our observation period.
We define the community of a news source on a given day,
as the set of all the people who have tweeted at least K1

DATA PROCESSING

We assembled two collections, one containing news articles
and the other containing Twitter messages (“tweets”).2

3.1

Aggregating articles into stories

News articles can be aggregated into stories that discuss
a common event or topic. In order to create news stories,
we measured the cosine similarity of pairs of articles using
TF.IDF weighting. We use the same measure of text similarity in other tasks throughout the paper. Two articles
having a similarity larger than θ = 0.4 (set empirically on
a hold-out set) were considered equivalent in terms of content. We built a graph containing all articles, joining by an
edge all articles having a similarity larger than the threshold. Each story corresponds to one connected component of
this graph, similarly to [25]. These sub-graphs were postprocessed to increase precision, ensuring that all articles on
each group were closely related to each other. The postprocess consisted in recursively removing all vertices with
degree less than 2.

SELECTION BIASES

Selection bias is also known as gatekeeping. Printed media
has space constraints, whereas radio and television broadcast have temporal constraints. These force editors to routinely take decisions about which (out of potentially hundreds or thousands of news stories) to cover. The Web allows
for more latitude, but selectivity is still present.

4.1

Prolificacy and exclusivity

To place selection biases in context, we first study the
quantity of stories in online media, and the extent to which
those stories are exclusive to one specific news source.
We first compare news sources and their communities in
terms of their overall prolificacy. The number of articles
each source publishes during a 2-week period is typically in
the low hundreds but can reach up to a few thousand in
certain cases. We find that the number of different stories a
source publishes is correlated (r2 = 0.83) with the number
of articles (distinct URLs) that are published, i.e. the more
articles a news source posts, the more likely they are to cover
a story. Looking at communities, larger communities tend to
post9 more stories (r2 = 0.73), and communities post about
2-3 times more stories than the news sources they follow.
Next we observe to what extent the content posted by
a news source is unique. A sizable fraction of the English
content in news media is produced by agencies. According to [17], “only four organizations do extensive international reporting (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC), a few others do
some international reporting (CNN, MSN, New York Times,
Guardian) and most do no original international reporting.” For each article i, we compute its exclusivity Ei as
Ei = 1 − max(sim(i, j)), where sim is the cosine similarity
with TF.IDF weighting and the maximum is taken across all
articles j 6= i. We find that Associated Press (AP) and other
agencies have the most content that is not exclusive. The
Economist, Newsweek, and other magazines have the largest
amount of original stories; they tend to carry a smaller number of stories, but most of their content is exclusive. Exclusivity seems to be weakly correlated (negatively) with the
number of stories each media covers (r2 = −0.4), suggesting that in news online being prolific does not necessarily
require having more original content.

articles from that news source in the past K2 days. While
we expect communities to be dynamic, we do not expect
them to change completely from day to day, hence we tune
the two parameters K1 and K2 to provide a certain degree
of stability. After experimentation, we set K1 = 3, K2 = 3,
which produces communities that change by roughly 10% of
their members every day on average.
Previous works e.g. [1] have considered the followers of a
news source on Twitter as its community. While our definition is different, community sizes according to both definitions are correlated (r2 = 0.74, computed in log-log scale).
The few exceptions are news media sources with content
that does not change on a daily basis, such as Newsweek.
The number of common followers in Twitter between USbased news media has been found to be correlated with political leaning [1]. We perform the same measurement in international news media and with our definition of communities, and found this to be correlated more with geographical
factors than political leaning. The resulting graph, thresholded at communities having a Jaccard coefficient greater
to 0.03, is shown in Figure 1. We observe clear clusters
for UK-, USA-, India-, and Australian-based media. Community overlaps vary widely, with 90% of the news sources
having between 2% and 34% of their community shared with
at least one other source. The exclusivity of the community
of a news source is to a large extent independent from the
community size (r2 = 0.14).
The complete list of data sources, including details on
their number of articles, their number of followers, community sizes, and example stories, are included in the Supplementary Material.

4.2

Selection bias and prominence

A major factor affecting the selection of stories is their
relative importance [7]. We measure the prominence of each
story, which corresponds to the fraction of news sources that
has at least one article about the story. As in [4], this number ranges from a maximum of 1.0 if the story is in the N
news sources in a sample, to a minimum of 1/N if it is only
in 1 of them.
Different news sources may have different policies for the
selection of stories. For instance one news media may want
to cover only the top stories of the day, while another may
want to include a number of minor/niche ones. Indeed, we
observe in practice a wide range of prominence distributions
across stories published by online news media. In general
magazine-type of media such as The Economist or Newsweek
tends to focus on stories of high prominence, and covering

of its members posts on Twitter the URL of one article belonging to a story.

1681

less stories is correlated with having larger average prominence (r2 = −0.51).
Social media, in principle, should allow a broader selection
of stories, including niche ones. In general the prominence
of stories posted by social media communities is significantly
smaller than the prominence of the news media source they
follow. In particular, stories of large prominence are not
posted as often by social media users. Two factors may
contribute to this. First, given that social media users do
not need to appeal to a broad audience, they may have a
stronger preference for niche content. Second, saturation
effects have been observed in Twitter; [20] demonstrated
that the probability that a user posts something initially
increases with the number of exposures to it, but then drops.
Both factors may contribute to observing more stories of
smaller prominence in social media.
Statistics for each data source in terms of exclusivity, as
well as details on our analysis of prolificacy and examples of
prominence distribution for some media can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

order to visualize this similarity matrix, we project it in two
dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The result is shown in Figures 2(a) for news sources and 2(b)
for social media communities. For online news sources, there
is a clear separation between US-based media and the rest.
In social media communities, there is much more mixing
of different regions. This means that US-based news media tends to agree in their selection of stories, while their
communities in social media are interested in a more diverse
range of issues. However, as shown next in Section 5.2, they
both tend to be more geographically homogeneous when
looking at the amount of attention they devote to stories.

Selection bias and geography

Measuring coverage bias

There are several ways in which the distribution of attention given to stories can be quantified. In each news
source, we can look at the length of the articles covering
the story, counting words and adding across multiple articles of the same story, when necessary. In social media, we
count the number of tweets containing links to articles on a
given story. Communities tend to be influenced by the news
media source they follow. A story prominently displayed
and promoted by traditional news sources should obtain a
larger number of social media reactions from its community.
In addition to observing the distribution of coverage of stories, we can also quantify coverage biases in the treatment
of different people, by measuring the distribution of number
of mentions per person across different media. These distributions are compared by using the Jensen-Shannon (JS)
divergence between them for each pair of news sources, and
for each pair of social media communities. Coverage bias by
story words and by people mentions are somewhat correlated
(r = 0.68). Interestingly, news media coverage as measured
by the length of the stories is correlated with the one observed in the distribution of social media reactions across
all communities (r = 0.84), but not so correlated with the
distribution of tweets in each media’s community (r = 0.40).
This is in agreement with classical results by [13]; the importance given by people to different issues tends to be more
correlated with media as a whole than with the specific media source(s) each person follows.
More details on the correlations between selection and
coverage bias can be found in the Supplementary Material.

Next we compare news media according to the overlap in
the stories they post, measured by computing for every pair
of media the Jaccard coefficient of their sets of stories. In

COVERAGE BIAS

Coverage bias is a preference for giving more airtime, space,
or attention to some issues in contrast to others [5]. While
two news media may publish articles about the same story,
it might be the case that one gives the story much more
attention than the other.

Coverage bias, geography, and politics

We measure the extent of coverage bias with respect to
geographical regions and partisan politics.
The distribution of the coverage of different stories, as
measured in terms of number of words, is strongly correlated with geographical regions, as shown in Figure 2(c).
The same happens if we look at the distribution of tweets
given to different stories by communities, depicted in Figure 2(d). In both cases, the geographical biases are more
evident than when measured using selection-bias metrics.
This means that, as expected [7], news media tends to write
articles about the country/region where they are based, and

that those articles tend to be longer and more frequently
tweeted by their social media communities. The same geographical biases have been observed online with respect to
search queries [23], indicating that users are interested in
what is happening around them, and what is happening to
those around them.
We observe that the amount of attention social media
communities dedicate to stories follows geographical regions
more closely than their selection of stories (compare Figures 2(d) and 2(b)). The relative diversity in terms of selection can be explained by considering the broad range of
stories that each community covers, and the low prominence
of those stories. The similarities in terms of coverage are
aligned with previous findings [21], in the sense that while
anyone in social media can propose new ideas (news stories
in our case), only few ideas succeed in getting enough attention. Therefore, although communities talk about a broad
range of news, they spend most of their time in a few of
them, behaving similarly to traditional news sources.
Next, we use a list of USA-based news sources classified by political party from [2], considering six conservatives
(Chicago Tribune, Fox, Forbes, NY Post, Newsmax, U.S.
News and Washintong Times) and five liberals (ABC, CBS,
NY Times, Huffington and Washington Post). We found a
strong correlation between political leaning and measures
of coverage of stories (this was not the case when using
measures of selection of stories). This is depicted in Figure 3 where we project in 2 dimensions the matrix of JSdivergence between the coverage of media sources. We can
see that the distribution of tweets per story follows partisan
lines closely, whereas the distribution of story lengths also
exhibits the same bias, but not as clearly as in social media.
The fact that these biases are stronger in social media than
in traditional online news may be due to traditional media
attempting to strive for an ideal of objectivity that social
media users may not aspire to. This agrees with results in
Section 6 where we show that in social media the language
seems to be more strongly opinionated.

able tool to study emotions expressed in text, e.g. [16] looked
at the relationship between tweet sentiments and polls in order to examine how the sentiments expressed in Twitter can
be used as political or economic indicators.
We sort all named entities of type person in our dataset
by decreasing number of mentions. The top of this list is
dominated by politicians of international relevance, so we
focus on a group of 10 present and former heads of state (plus
the Secretary of State of the USA and the Secretary General
of the United Nations, both prominently mentioned in our
sample). We merge entities referring to the same person,
e.g. “Obama” and “Barack Obama”. The list is shown in
Table 1.
We analyze the sentiments used in relationship to persons
in our list, using the dictionary provided by the Affective
Norms for English Words (ANEW) [3]. We use the valence
dimension, which assign to each word a number from 1 (if it
evokes sadness, dissatisfaction and despair) to 9 (if it evokes
happiness, satisfaction, hope). The average sentiment for a
person on a news source is the micro-average of sentiments in
all the statement on all the articles mentioning that person.
The average sentiment for a person on a news community is
the average of sentiments in all the tweets posted by members of that community mentioning the person (according
to an exact string match of the last name, which due to
their prominence and as verified in our sample, is almost
invariably a reference to the correct person).
Statistics about the distribution of the valence of sentiments are shown in Table 1. In general the lower quantile
(more negative sentiments) is significantly lower in social
media communities when compared to news sources, across
all the persons included in our sample. Other anecdotal examples can be found in the Supplementary Material.

STATEMENT BIAS

7.

Statement bias has been used to describe a tendency towards using more favorable statements to refer to one political party at the expense of another [5]. In this section, we
study such statements with respect to people in the news,
by using sentiment analysis to determine the emotional valence (positive or negative) of expressions in which people
are mentioned. Sentiment analysis has shown to be a valu-

RELATED WORK

Reputable news reports are expected to be objective; their
role is to inform people about what is happening in the
world. It is however known that bias exists in the way
news is reported by the media e.g. [9]. Most attempts to
detect bias are still done on a small scale, with news manually examined and coded. In this paper, we automatically
process a large sample of articles published in several in-

ternational English-speaking online news sites, avoiding the
manual coding of articles.
Recently, [12], examined the presence of coverage bias in
mainstream news and blogs. They show that overall only a
slight slant in terms of party and political leaning could be
observed. However, this changes during important political
events, such as a mid-term election. We also observe some
slight political slants, but the geographical bias seems more
prevalent.
In this paper, we focus on three types of bias, selection
(gatekeeping), coverage, and statement bias, all studied before. For instance, [5] found no substantial bias on US magazines, but a small coverage bias was detected on US television. With respect to coverage bias, [22] studied Dutch
and German television and observed that top leaders such
as chancellors or prime ministers get a substantially larger
number of mentions than the second most mentioned politicians. Finally, for statement bias, [14] found large differences in the sentiment polarity with which US candidates
were treated.

CONCLUSIONS

The

[10] B. G. Knight and C.-F. Chiang. Media bias and influence: Evidence from newspaper endorsements. Working Paper 14445, National Bureau of Economic Research, October 2008.

We studied the presence of bias in online news and the
social media communities that surround them. Our results
support the following high-level conclusions.
In international news media, selection and coverage biases seem more correlated with geographical variables than
political leaning. In other words, online news sources in a
given geographical region tend to select the same stories,
and write articles of similar relative length. Social media
follows the same pattern, with the communities of media in
a region showing a similar proportion of tweets to stories.
Political bias is evident in social media, in terms of the
distribution of tweets different stories receive. This distribution is more closely related among communities of news
media having the same political leaning (at least in the US
for which we could obtain political leaning information). Political bias is also observable in terms of the distribution of
length of articles on different stories in traditional media,
but to a smaller extent than in social media. Statement
bias is also evident in social media. In a sample of statements referring to world leaders, we find that the language
used in social media is more opinionated, and often more
negative, than the one used in traditional news media.
In terms of editorial policies regarding the prominence or
importance of stories covered, we observe that magazinetype of news (which in general covers less articles and stories) tends to select stories of high prominence and produce
exclusive content. More importantly, we observe that social
media tend to be much more focused in niche content than
traditional news media. In particular, very prominent stories seem to receive much less attention in social media than
in traditional news sources.
