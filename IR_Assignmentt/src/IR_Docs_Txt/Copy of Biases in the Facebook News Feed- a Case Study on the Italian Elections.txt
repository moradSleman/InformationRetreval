Abstract— Facebook News Feed personalization algorithm
has a significant impact, on a daily basis, on the lifestyle,
mood and opinion of millions of Internet users. Nonetheless,
the behavior of such algorithms usually lacks transparency,
motivating measurements, modeling and analysis in order to
understand and improve its properties. In this paper, we propose a reproducible methodology encompassing measurements
and an analytical model to capture the visibility of publishers
over a News Feed. First, measurements are used to parameterize
and to validate the expressive power of the proposed model.
Then, we conduct a what-if analysis to assess the visibility bias
incurred by the users against a baseline derived from the model.
Our results indicate that a significant bias exists and it is more
prominent at the top position of the News Feed. In addition,
we found that the bias is non-negligible even for users that are
deliberately set as neutral with respect to their political views.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSNs) are increasingly being
used to share political opinion and news, particularly during
election periods [24]. With almost 2 billion active users per
month, Facebook is currently the largest OSN [10]. As any
platform for media sharing, one of the core functions of
Facebook is to organize the available information to improve
user experience. To that aim, Facebook counts on a filtering
and personalization product referred to as the News Feed
algorithm [19].
In essence, the News Feed algorithm is a recommendation
system that presents posts to users in their News Feed.
However, unlike classical recommendation systems, e.g., for
music and movies, the News Feed poses its own set of
challenges. The News Feed needs to account for content
continuously generated by multiple sources (publishers), and
users typically do not provide explicit feedback about the
recommendations. In addition, the News Feed algorithm may
impact users that are usually unaware of its influence [16],
e.g., by creating a filter bubble that reinforces the perceived
users’ opinions [28]. Clearly, the News Feed algorithm influences the way political discourse is perceived, potentially
creating biases towards sources and ultimately impacting
how democracy works.
In this paper we take important steps towards measuring,
modeling and analyzing the bias caused by the News Feed
algorithm. We believe that a better understanding of the
News Feed can be instrumental in the design of new filtering

algorithms, which may eventually be actively controlled by
users. Furthermore, obtaining this knowledge through public
and reproducible measurements is key for increasing the
awareness of users about the filtering of the content they
consume.
The literature on the News Feed algorithm is vast, including measurements [9], [6], [7], [8], models [2], [12]
and user awareness surveys [16]. Nonetheless, most of the
prior work that quantifies the effect of OSNs on information
diffusion [5], [4] relies on measurements obtained through
restrictive non-disclosure agreements that are not made publicly available to other researchers and practitioners. As the
data analyzed in such studies is very sensitive, and their
sources are not audited, there are multiple potential factors
and confounding variables that are unreachable to the general
public. Our goal is to provide insights on the filtering that
occurs in OSNs through a reproducible methodology and a
dataset that we have made publicly available [1].
In this work, we propose a methodology that encompasses
measurements and a model for the analysis of bias in OSNs.
Our key contributions are summarized as follows.
A measurement methodology is introduced to publicly
and transparently audit the OSN ecosystem, focusing on
the Facebook News Feed algorithm. The methodology encompasses an Internet browser extension to autonomously
and independently collect information on the posts presented
to users by the News Feed algorithm (Section II). Such
information is not available through the Facebook API.
Empirical findings are reported using data collected from
a measurement campaign conducted during the 2018 Italian
elections. We observed that a) the filtering algorithm tends
to select information that is aligned with user’s perceived
political orientation, b) this effect is more prominent at the
topmost News Feed position and c) neutral users are also
exposed to non-uniform filtering (Section III).
An analytical model is proposed to quantify the visibility
and occupancy of publishers in the users News Feeds. The
model allows us to conduct a what-if analysis, to assess the
metrics of interest under different filtering mechanisms and
is validated using data from the Italian election experiment
(Section IV).
A model-based bias assessment is conducted using
the Italian dataset. The dataset is used to parameterize the

proposed model, and yields a baseline publisher visibility
(i.e., without the influence of the News Feed algorithm). The
measured visibility is then contrasted against the baseline
to quantify the bias, i.e., how publishers’ occupancies are
affected by user’s orientations as they are perceived by the
News Feed algorithm (Section V).
II. M EASUREMENT M ETHODOLOGY
The goal of our experiments is to assess the bias experienced by OSN users through a reproducible method. To
this aim, we created controlled virtual users that have no
social ties and that follow a preselected set of sources. By
considering minimalistic user profiles, we can assess how
preferences towards sources affect posts presented to users.
In what follows, we first introduce some basic terminology, followed by our data collection methodology, contrasting it against the state of the art. Finally, we present the
metrics of interest which are evaluated in the remainder of
this work.
A. Terminology
Publisher is a source that publishes posts. Each publisher
is associated to a public page, which contains all the posts
published by that source.
News Feed is the personal page of a given Facebook
user, which contains all the posts that Facebook suggests
to that user, in an ordered list. We use the terms News Feed
and timeline interchangeably. With some abuse of notation,
News Feed also refers to the algorithm used by Facebook
to recommend posts to users. The distinction between the
ordered lists of posts and the algorithm used to fill such lists
should be clear from the context.
A user who follows a publisher subscribes to that publisher
to receive its posts. A user must follow a publisher to have
post from the publisher’s page in the user’s News Feed.
In our work, all bots follow the same set of preselected
publishers.
A user who likes a page from a publisher automatically
follows that page. A user likes a page to show general
support for that page and its posts. In addition, a user can
also like individual posts. In our work, users orientations are
established by letting them like a subset of the preselected
publishers, as well as posts from this subset of publishers.
B. Data collection methodology
Next, we present our measurement methodology.
Select representative pages We preselect a set of representative public Facebook pages (publishers). This selection
is subjective in nature, and must account for the classification
of publishers into categories. In the case of political elections,
representative pages include newspapers and the pages of the
political parties.
Create representative virtual users We create representative virtual Facebook users which capture tendencies on the
selected representative pages. Such users are also referred to
as bots. Each bot follows all the preselected representative
pages. In addition, each bot may have an orientation, which

may be captured by one of a number of mechanisms provided
by Facebook. For instance, a bot may 1) “like” a page, 2)
“like” a post from a page or 3) “comment” posts from a page.
We also consider a bot that does not have an orientation. We
refer to it as undecided.
Collect snapshots and impressions Each bot kept open
an Internet browser window (Firefox or Chrome) accessing
the Facebook page. The bots were instrumented to collect
data on the posts to which they were exposed. To that aim,
a browser extension, named Facebook Tracking Exposed, or
simply fbtrex [1] was developed. The extension auto-scrolls
the Facebook window at pre-established instants of the day.
Every auto-scroll produces a set of posts which are stored at a
local database. Each set of posts is referred to as a snapshot.
Typically, each bot is scheduled to collect thirteen snapshots
per day. Each post appearing in a snapshot counts as a post
impression. At each bot, Facebook Tracking Exposed collects
all impressions and records their corresponding publisher,
publication time, impression time, content, number of “likes”
and number of shares.
Collect all published posts We also have a second
dataset which contains the set of all posts published by
the representative pages during the interval of interest, as
provided by the Facebook API. This dataset is used to study
what users would experience in the absence of filters, or in
the presence of alternative filters.
Compute metrics of interest and analyze biases Bias is
defined with respect to a baseline metric, which subsumes a
model. A simple model is introduced in Section IV and the
corresponding bias is reported in Section V.
Share datasets and scripts By sharing the datasets and
scripts, we allow other researchers to reproduce the obtained
results and to collect new data. We envision that the collective sampling and analysis of the News Feed is a key step
towards building awareness and transparency.
C. State of the art
Information about post impressions used to be available
in a deprecated version of the Facebook API from 2015.
In any case, that information was not necessarily reliable
as recognized by Facebook itself [20]. For such reasons,
we believe that fbtrex and the methodology described in
this section constitute important building blocks to promote
transparency in the Facebook ecosystem. Related work is
further discussed in Section VI.
D. Metrics of interest
Next, we define our key metrics of interest that will be
obtained from the dataset generated by the experiment. We
consider the top K positions of the News Feed of each user.
Let Qij be the number of unique posts from publisher j
viewed at bot i. Let Si be the number of snapshots taken by
bot i. Then, the measured effective arrival rate of publisher
j at bot i is given by
λ̃ij =

Qij
.
Si

(1)

Let Iij be the number of impressions of publisher j at bot
i. Let Nij be the average number of posts of publisher j in
the top K positions of the News Feed of bot i. Nij is given
by
Iij
Nij =
.
(2)
Si
Let πij be the fraction of snapshots that contain at least one
post from publisher j in the top K positions of the News
Feed of user i. We refer to πij and Nij as the visibility and
the occupancy of publisher j at News Feed i, respectively.
The normalized occupancy is given by Nij /K. The visibility
and the normalized occupancy are two metrics of exposure
of publishers. They can be interpreted as the probabilities
that user i sees a post of publisher j if the user goes through
all the posts in the News Feed or if he/she picks randomly a
single post in the News Feed, respectively. In this paper, due
to space limitations we focus primarily on the occupancy.
III. E XPERIMENTAL F INDINGS
Next, we report empirical findings on the 2018 Italian
elections.
A. Experimental setup
The Italian election was held on March 4th 2018, and
our experiment was conducted between January 10, 2018
and March 6, 2018, encompassing the preparation for the
election campaign and the reactions to its outcome.
We asked some Italian voters to select a set of thirty
representative public Facebook pages, six for each of the
following five political orientations: center-left, far-right,
left, five-star movement (M5S) and right. Due to space
limitations, the selection of representative pages is reported
in our technical report.1 The classification of publishers into
political categories may obviously be questionable, but our
focus in this paper is on the methodology rather than on
specific political conclusions. Moreover, most of our results
are detailed on a per-publisher basis.
Then, we created six virtual Facebook users. Recall that
each bot followed all the thirty preselected pages. We gave
to five bots a specific political orientation, by making each
of them like pages from the corresponding publishers. The
sixth bot is undecided, and does not like any page.
Each bot was scheduled to collect thirteen snapshots per
day. Snapshots were collected once every hour, from 7 am
to 7 pm (Italian local time). The collected snapshots and
impressions, together with the set of all posts published by
the thirty representative pages, obtained through Facebook
API, constitute our dataset.
B. Experimental findings
a) The effect of filtering is stronger at the topmost News
Feed position: Figure 1 shows the normalized publisher occupancy as a function of the timeline size. The publishers are
ordered and colored according to their political orientation.
It can be seen that the occupancy concentration is higher
1 http://bit.ly/2KfT3Hn

at the topmost positions, and asymptotic values are reached
when K ≈ 10. The noteworthy bias on the topmost position
is referred to in the literature as ranking bias [3] and must be
placed under scrutiny, as there is a strong correlation between
position and click rates [4], [14] .
b) Occupancy reflects orientation: Figure 1 also shows
that the occupancies reflect the orientation of the bots. For
instance, the News Feed of the bot with a center-left orientation was occupied mostly by center-left (red) publishers.
As a notable exception, center-left posts were prevalent
in the News Feed of the bot with a far-right orientation.
Nonetheless, the occupancy of far-right posts in that bot was
still the highest among all bots.
c) Noticeable publishers selection: The bars in Figure 2
show the total number of impressions per publisher in the
topmost position of the News Feed of each bot (the color of
the bars indicates the orientation). For the sake of readability,
only publishers that achieved a normalized occupancy larger
than 5% are represented in this figure. The black dots
correspond to the number of posts created by each publisher
(the publishers are ordered by the number of posts created).
Figure 2 shows that only a small subset of publishers are
represented in topmost positions. For example, the centerleft bot sees only posts from center-left and M5S publishers.
Moreover, the number of impressions per publisher is not
proportional to the number of posts the publisher created,
a further indication of a filtering effect from News Feed
algorithm.
d) Neutral users are also exposed to non-uniform filtering: It is worth noting that filtering affects also the
“undecided” bot, with some publishers over-represented in
the News feed.
IV. N EWS F EED M ODEL
a) Model description: Next, we derive an analytical
model for a FIFO implementation of the News Feed. We
assume that a News Feed has K slots, new posts are inserted
at the top of the News Feed and each new arrival shifts older
posts one position lower. A post is evicted from the News
Feed when it is shifted from position K.
Let I be the set of I users, and let J be the set of J
publishers: Ji denotes the set of publishers followed by user
i ∈ I. Publisher j ∈ J publishes posts according to a
Poisson process with rate Λj . The total publishing rate is
PJ
Λ = j=1 Λj . Let λij ≤ Λj be the effective arrival rate of
posts published by j in the News Feed of user i. We denote
by λi the aggregate
P rate of posts published in the News Feed
of user i, λi = Jj=1 λij . We further let λi,−j be the arrival
rate of posts in the News Feed of user i from all publishers
other than j, λi,−j = λi − λij . All the variables used are
summarized in Table I.
b) Metrics of interest: We consider the News Feed of
user i. Subscript (m) is used to denote metrics computed
using the analytical model. The visibility of publisher j
(m)
is given by πij = 1 − (λi,−j /λi )K , and the rationale
goes as follows. After every new arrival, with probability
λi,−j /λi the topmost post of publisher j will be shifted down

Figure 4 shows bias estimates obtained from the Italian
elections experiment. Black dots indicate model predictions
of bias, obtained directly from the measurements together
with equation (4). We evaluated 95% confidence intervals
for the bias using a bootstrapping model-free non-parametric
resampling method. To this purpose, one thousand virtual
experiments have been conducted. Each experiment consisted
in sampling, with replacement, from the set of posts collected
by fbtrex (to estimate confidence intervals for Nij ) and from
the set of posts obtained from the Facebook API dataset
(u)
(to estimate confidence intervals for Nij ). Bars and error
bars show the average points and the boundaries of the 95%
confidence intervals for the bias.
Figure 4 provides further insights on the findings reported
in Section III. In particular, we observe a strong positive
bias towards La Republica at the far-right and M5S bots
and a strong negative bias towards Il Giornale at all bots.
In addition, the bias experienced by the left-oriented user is
particularly well aligned with its profile. Note also that there
is a strong positive bias towards M5S posts at the undecided
bot. M5S was the party with the largest number of votes in
the 2018 Italian general election. We also observed that the
bias profile of the undecided neutral user is similar to that
of the right-oriented one.

that to generate Figure 3 we relied on the effective arrival
rates of posts, λij . Future work consists of inferring such
rates directly from publishers and users profiles, e.g., using
machine learning techniques.
V. Q UANTIFYING B IAS : A M ODEL -BASED A PPROACH
We provide further insight on the influence of the News
Feed personalization algorithm. To this aim, we propose a
model-based bias analysis.
(m)
Recall that Nij is the occupancy computed from (3),
using the effective arrival rates λij of publisher j at bot i.
(u)
Alternatively, let Nij be the occupancy of publisher j at bot
i in the unfiltered scenario wherein all posts published appear
(u)
in the feed. Nij is obtained from (3), letting λij = Λj and
P
(u)
λi = j Λj . We observe that Nij is the same for all the
(u)
users and we denote it simply as Nj .
We define the bias as the difference between the two
occupancies, i.e.
(m)

bij = Nij

(u)

− Nj .

(4)

Note that the definition of bias is general, and can be coupled
with different base-line models of occupancy. Utility-driven
models of visibility, inspired by [11], [29], [25], are currently
one of our subjects of study.

There is a vast literature on how the Facebook News Feed
works, including topological aspects related to cascading
structures and growth [22], [33], [9] and its effects on
the creation of echo chambers and polarization [6], [7]. In
this paper, we study the News Feed filtering impact on the
dissemination of information, measuring and modeling the
visibility of publishers and posts in the News Feed.
A. Public datasets and reproducible methodologies
The behavior of users searching for visibility was studied
in [17], [8], [31]. Such studies are primarily based on small
datasets. A notable exception is [4], [5], who considered
a massive dataset provided by Facebook through restrictive
non-disclosure agreements. Datasets to assess Facebook publishers’ visibilities are usually not made publicly available.
Our work aims to contribute by filling that gap.
The proposed methodology meets the set of principles
intended to ensure fairness in the evolving policy and technology ecosystem introduced by the ACM [21]: awareness,
access and redness, accountability, explanation, data provenance, auditability, and validation and testing. We particularly focus on awareness, explanation and auditability, as we
do not rely on the Facebook API to collect impressions.
In this paper we profile Facebook, which is taken as a
black box to be scientifically analyzed. This approach dates
back to Skinner tests [15], and has been gaining significant
attention in the literature of social networks [32].
B. Bias and visibility models
The awareness of users about the News Feed algorithm
was evaluated in [18]. Eslami et al. reported that 62, 5% of

the interviewed Facebook users were unaware of the News
Feed algorithm. Users believed that every post from their
friends and followed pages appeared in their News Feed.

VII. D ISCUSSION

The bias in algorithms, and forms to audit it, were investigated in [13], [30]. In [14] it was shown that search engine
ranking manipulation can influence the vote of undecided
citizens. This bias was further quantified in [26]. With the
help of our model, we can quantify the bias in the Facebook
News Feed.

FIFO model The proposed FIFO model is a preliminary
step to capture News Feed dynamics. The stronger filtering
at the topmost News Feed positions, that we observed in Section III, cannot be justified by FIFO operation. Nonetheless,
this simple model already allows us to appreciate what kind
of analysis can be conducted by combining measurements
and analytical tools. We are currently working on a more
complex model, e.g., to account for different residence times
for different posts using time-to-live counters [11], [25], [29].

News Feed models were previously proposed in [2], [12]
and [29]. In this paper, we propose a simple News Feed
model and validate it using real-world data. It is out of the
scope of this paper to present a nuts-and-bolts perspective on
how the Facebook News Feed works. Instead, our goal was
to provide a simple model that can explain the occupancy
and visibility of different publishers, given a reproducible
measurement framework. As in any scientific experiment,
we cope with a tradeoff between model expressive power
and simplicity. In this preliminary work, we considered the
simplest possible News Feed model, namely a FIFO model,
that produces meaningful results.
The implications of the limited budget of attention of users
in OSNs have been previously studied by Reiffers-Masson
et al. [27] and Jiang et al. [23]. In these two papers, the
authors consider the problem of optimally deciding what to
post and to read, respectively. Such works are complementary
to ours. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous
works considered the problem of inferring the visibility of
publishers from News Feed measurements.

Small number of users Our experimental methodology
encompasses a small number of bots (users), as each bot must
go through a full Facebook account registration. In particular,
in our case study we considered six bots. We believe that
such bots already provide a representative perspective on the
biases introduced by Facebook, and we use bootstrapping
techniques to generate additional samples from our observations. Future work consists of increasing the number of
bots to tens of bots, including bots with similar profiles to
compare their impressions.
Compliance to Facebook policies Our methodology encompasses the creation of fake users, as we use a limited
number of experimental Facebook accounts to follow and
like public pages. Such accounts have a very low impact
on the system, as they do not have real or virtual friends.
To minimize potential harm, we remove our experimental
Facebook accounts after we are done with our experiments.

VIII. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed a framework for reproducible
measurements and analysis of the Facebook News Feed
algorithm. The framework encompasses an analytical model
which enables quantitative what-if analysis to assess the bias
introduced by the News Feed algorithm.
We were able to conclude that the algorithm tends to
reinforce the orientation indicated by users about the pages
they “like”, by filtering posts and creating biases among
the set of followed publishers. The effects of filtering are
stronger on the topmost position where only a fraction of
the set of publishers followed by the users was represented.
We observed that a neutral user that did not “like” any page
was also exposed to a noticeable bias.
Facebook mission is to “give people the power to build
community.” We believe that the measurements, model and
tools presented in this work are one step further towards that
goal, as they help evaluating algorithms’ transparency and
promote user awareness about the filtering process they are
submitted to. Ultimately, such awareness is key to protect
and empower Facebook users, communities, society and
democracy as a whole.
