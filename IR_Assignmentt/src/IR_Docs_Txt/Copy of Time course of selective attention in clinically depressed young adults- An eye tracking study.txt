Depressed individuals display biased attention for emotional information when stimuli are presented for
relatively ‘‘long’’ (e.g., 1 s) durations. The current study examined whether attentional biases are sustained over a much longer period. Speciﬁcally, clinically depressed and never depressed young adults
simultaneously viewed images from four emotion categories (sad, threat, positive, neutral) for 30 s while
line of visual gaze was assessed. Depressed individuals spent signiﬁcantly more time viewing dysphoric
images and less time viewing positive images than their never depressed counterparts. Time course
analyses indicated that these biases were maintained over the course of the trial. Results suggest that
depressed participants’ attentional biases for dysphoric information are sustained for relatively long
periods even when other emotional stimuli are present. Mood congruent information-processing biases
appear to be a robust feature of depression and may have an important role in the maintenance of the
disorder.

Cognitive theories of depression postulate that depressed individuals are characterized by negative biases in information
processing (e.g., Beck, 1976). In general, these models propose that
biases in attention, perception, and memory serve to maintain
a major depressive episode. In regard to attention, depressed
individuals are expected to selectively attend to negative stimuli
and ﬁlter out positive stimuli. This bias, in turn, is thought to
contribute to the maintenance of the disorder.
Numerous studies of attentional biases in depression have been
conducted. Despite initial null ﬁndings (e.g., MacLeod, Mathews, &
Tata, 1986; Mogg, Bradley, Williams, & Mathews, 1993), more recent
work has documented an association between depression and
biased attention. For instance, Gotlib, Krasnoperova, Yue, and
Joorman (2004) reported an attentional bias for sad facial expressions in a clinically depressed sample using a dot probe task (Gotlib
et al., 2004). Gotlib et al. (2004) and Joormann and Gotlib (2007)
subsequently replicated this ﬁnding. Caseras, Garner, Bradley, and
Mogg (2007) provided further evidence that dysphoric individuals
maintained their gaze longer on negative pictures than nondysphoric people.

One explanation for why this recent work has more consistently
found an attentional bias for negative stimuli involves the stimulus
duration. Early work tended to use relatively brief stimulus durations (e.g., 500 ms). More recent work has used longer stimulus
durations (e.g., 1000 ms). Given this set of ﬁndings, Mogg and
Bradley (2005) have suggested that depression is not associated
with an initial orienting bias, but instead attentional biases are
more likely to be observed under conditions that allow or
encourage elaborative processing (i.e., longer stimulus durations).
Indeed, this is consistent with other conceptualizations that point
to sustained processing as a critical factor for the maintenance of
depression (e.g., Siegle, Granholm, Ingram, & Matt, 2001).
To date, few studies of biased attention have used assessments
that measure sustained processing of emotional stimuli. Commonly
used dot probe tasks obtain a ‘‘snapshot’’ of biased processing, as an
attentional bias is measured by reaction time immediately
following the offset of the stimulus. If the probe is consistently
detected more quickly when it replaces dysphoric stimuli, a bias for
dysphoric stimuli is inferred. Use of multiple stimulus durations
can assess the time course of sustained processing; however,
assessing more than two or three stimulus durations often becomes
difﬁcult due to subject burden. Therefore, reaction time tasks may
provide an excellent assessment of early processing but yield
a somewhat incomplete picture of sustained information
processing.
To overcome this issue, a relatively new paradigm has been
proposed in which tracking of eye movements provides a relatively continuous index of information processing (Hermans,

J.L. Kellough et al. / Behaviour Research and Therapy 46 (2008) 1238–1243

Vansteenwegen, & Eelen, 1999; Isaacowitz, 2005). Under normal
viewing conditions, individuals typically direct their line of gaze
towards stimuli that attract their attention (Jonides, 1981). While
attention can be moved without eye movements under certain
laboratory conditions, the converse is not true; there is an
obligatory shift in attention prior to every eye movement
(Kowler, Anderson, Dosher, & Blaser, 1995). Shifts in gaze position thus closely follow and are guided by shifts in attentional
focus. Further, measuring eye movements avoids problems of
slow and variable motor responses observed in some psychiatric
conditions (Mathews, Ridgeway, & Williamson, 1996). Visual
attention is not typically confounded by such motor-slowing
deﬁcits. Most importantly, eye tracking methodology may be
ideally suited for measuring biased attention in depression, as
line of visual gaze can be assessed relatively continuously (e.g.,
sampled every 16 ms) across relatively long periods of time.
Only one small study of sustained information processing using
eye tracking methodology has been completed to date with
depressed individuals. Eizenman et al. (2003) used eye tracking
methodology to study the visual scanning pattern of depressed
(n ¼ 8) and non-depressed (n ¼ 9) individuals. Participants were
instructed to scan and re-scan four complex emotional images that
were presented simultaneously for 10.5 s. These images depicted
dysphoric, threat, positive, and neutral themes. Depressed participants spent signiﬁcantly more time attending to dysphoric images
than controls. This study also demonstrated that the average glance
duration for dysphoric images was signiﬁcantly longer for
depressed individuals suggesting difﬁcultly in shifting their attention away from dysphoric stimuli.
Given that only one study to date has examined attentional
biases in clinically depressed individuals using eye tracking methodology, we thought it was important to replicate the Eizenman
et al. (2003) ﬁndings. However, we also wanted to expand on this
previous work by examining the time course of biased attention.
Particularly, it is important to understand whether a depressed
individual’s selective attention for mood congruent stimuli
increases, decreases, or is sustained over time. This should provide
important insight into the nature and pervasiveness of biased
attention in major depressive disorder.
Using a similar eye tracking paradigm as Eizenman et al. (2003),
we obtained a relatively continuous measurement of selective
attention using eye tracking methodology while extending the
stimulus presentation time. Additionally, participants were
instructed to look freely at the images with no constraints, as if they
were watching television or viewing images in a photo album.
These modiﬁcations were implemented to encourage naturalistic
information processing, as in other eye tracking studies (Isaacowitz,
2005). Finally, in addition to examining the percentage of time
participants attended to each stimulus category over time, we also
examined whether depression groups differed in number of ﬁxations per stimulus category, glance duration for each stimulus type,
and location of ﬁrst ﬁxation to better characterize negatively biased
attention in depression.

participants. All participants were initially screened using the short
form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-SF) to assess for the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms. Individuals with
scores less than 4 and greater than 14 were recruited for the study.
Upon arrival for the study, individuals completed a diagnostic
interview and self-report assessments of current depression.
Inclusion criteria for the depressed group was a diagnosis of current
major depressive disorder (MDD) in the absence of past mania or
hypomania and a score of 15 or higher on the Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II). Inclusion in the never depressed group (ND)
required the absence of any current or past mood disorder and
a BDI-II score less than nine at the time of testing. Consistency
between interview-rated and self-reported depressive symptoms
(BDI-II score) was used to ensure that individuals with moderate
self-reported depressive symptoms were not included in the
nondepressed group and that individuals with few self-reported
symptoms of depression were not included in the depressed group.
Participants were excluded for the following reasons: past
depressive episode (never depressed group only, n ¼ 8), MDD in
partial remission (n ¼ 1), Bipolar II Disorder (n ¼ 1), lack of agreement between SCID diagnosis and BDI-II score (n ¼ 11), and difﬁculty in obtaining stable eye tracking (e.g., unacceptable head
movement, interference from glasses, eyelid occluded the pupil;
n ¼ 5). Therefore, the ﬁnal sample consisted of 60 participants (32
men and 28 women; age M ¼ 18.82, SD ¼ 0.90); 15 met diagnostic
criteria of major depressive disorder (BDI-II M ¼ 29.53, SD ¼ 8.77;
BAI M ¼ 22.87, SD ¼ 4.48; 60% female) and 45 were never depressed
participants (BDI-II M ¼ 2.71, SD ¼ 2.05; BAI M ¼ 22.87, SD ¼ 12.68;
47% female). The depressed and never-depressed groups did not
differ in terms of gender distribution c2 (n ¼ 45) ¼ 2.20, p ¼ 0.15.
Assessments
Diagnostic assessment
Major depressive disorder (MDD) was diagnosed with the Mood
Disorders Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSMIV Diagnoses – Patient Version (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &
Williams, 1998). Two trained assessors conducted all interviews.
Three advanced doctoral trainees acted as independent assessors
and each rated 20% of all interviews (n ¼ 15). Agreement on MDD
diagnosis was very good (kappas [k] ¼ 0.85–1.0).
Self-report measures of depression and anxiety
Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II:
Beck, Brown, & Steer, 1996) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI;
Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988), two widely used self-report
measures of depression and anxiety. Each questionnaire consists of
21 items that measure the presence and severity of cognitive,
affective, motivational, and physiological symptoms of depression
or anxiety. Past reports indicate adequate reliability and validity of
these measures (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988; Fydrich, Dowdall, &
Chambless, 1992).

Participants
Participants were 86 young adults between the ages of 18 and 21
years, either currently experiencing a major depressive episode or
with no history of major depression. These participants were
recruited from a large university and surrounding community in
the southwestern United States. Students (n ¼ 83) participated in
exchange for credit in their introductory psychology course while
community participants (n ¼ 3) were compensated monetarily
($20) for their time. A two-step procedure was used to recruit

This task involved simultaneous presentation of four images
selected from the International Affective Picture System (Lang,
Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005).2 Images from this picture system are

well standardized and used extensively in studies of psychopathology. Each slide contained 4 images, 1 of 12 images selected from
each of the following 4 categories: dysphoric, threat, neutral, and
positive (see Fig. 1).
The IAPS images have been systematically rated for valence but
not for speciﬁc emotion categories, such as dysphoric and threat.
We conducted a pilot study to categorize the negative images into
dysphoric and threat categories.3 The IAPS stimuli have previously
been rated on 9 point scales for valence (unpleasant ¼ 1 to pleasant ¼ 9) and arousal (calm ¼ 1 to excitement ¼ 9). Valence ratings
for the threatening and dysphoric images ranged from 2 to 4,
whereas positive images were rated from 6 to 8. Neutral images had
valence ratings of approximately 5.
The mean valence ratings for positive (M ¼ 7.3, SD ¼ 0.4) and
neutral (M ¼ 5.1, SD ¼ 0.2) images were signiﬁcantly different from
the other three categories (ts > 13.1, ps < 0.001), whereas the
valence ratings for dysphoric (M ¼ 2.4, SD ¼ 0.4) and threatening
(M ¼ 2.6, SD ¼ 0.6) images did not differ from each other (t ¼ 0.58,
ns). However, threatening (M ¼ 6.7, SD ¼ 0.6) images did have
a signiﬁcantly greater mean arousal rating than dysphoric (M ¼ 4.9,
SD ¼ 0.5), positive (M ¼ 4.6, SD ¼ 0.7), or neutral (M ¼ 2.8, SD ¼ 0.3)
images (ts > 7.8, ps < 0.001). In addition, neutral images had
a signiﬁcantly lower mean arousal rating than dysphoric, positive,
or threatening images (ts > 7.9, ps < 0.001), whereas the dysphoric
and positive images did not differ from each other in arousal
(ts ¼ 1.4, ns).

We conducted a pilot study to identify which emotion category best described
the negative images. Ninety undergraduate students were asked to rate how ‘‘sad’’
and ‘‘threatening’’ each of the 24 negative images was on a 9-point scale (not at
all ¼ 1 to extremely ¼ 9). Presentation order of the images was randomized across
participants and presentation order for the rating categories was counterbalanced.
As expected, the dysphoric images were rated as signiﬁcantly more sad than
threatening images (M ¼ 6.73, SD ¼ 1.89; M ¼ 4.15, SD ¼ 2.69, respectively),
t(89) ¼ 13.4, p < 0.001. Further, the threatening images were rated as signiﬁcantly
more threatening than dysphoric images (M ¼ 7.38, SD ¼ 1.86; M ¼ 2.71, SD ¼ 2.11,
respectively), t(89) ¼ 21.6, p < 0.001.

For each eye tracking trial, the location of each image was
randomly selected, with the constraint that each stimulus category
must occur in each of the four positions three times across 12 trials.
Eight ﬁller trials with four neutral images were presented to
obscure the nature of the task. A total of 20 trials (12 study þ 8
ﬁller) were presented in a new random order for each participant.
Each trial began with a 1000 ms centrally presented ﬁxation cross,
followed by presentation of stimuli for 30 s.
Eye tracking system
Line of visual gaze was assessed using a remote optics eye
tracking system model R6 from Applied Science Laboratories. Head
location was ﬁxed using a chin rest and forehead bar. The direction
of gaze, measured with x and y coordinates, was sampled every
16.7 ms (60 Hz). Eye movements that were stable for more than
100 ms within a 1 of visual angle were classiﬁed as a ﬁxation.
Areas of interest (AOIs) were also identiﬁed for each trial and corresponded with the total area for each of the four images. Thus, it
was possible to determine location of ﬁrst ﬁxation, number of
ﬁxations, and total time spent viewing each of the four images
presented during each trial (see Fig. 1). E-Prime software was used
to present the stimuli and to automate the recording of eye location
with the eye tracker software.
Procedure
After signing an informed consent form, participants completed
a demographics form, the BDI-II, BAI, and the Mood Disorders
Module from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID;
First et al., 1998). Participants were then escorted to the eye
tracking room and seated in a height adjustable chair and placed
their chin in a chin rest. The chin rest was positioned so that
participants’ eyes were level with the middle of the 17-inch
monitor on which the stimuli were presented. This ensured that all
participants’ eyes were in the same location relative to the camera

J.L. Kellough et al. / Behaviour Research and Therapy 46 (2008) 1238–1243

and the monitor. Camera adjustments were made to best capture
the participant’s right eye, and a 9-point calibration was completed
to conﬁrm that the eye tracker was recording line of visual gaze
within 1 of visual angle for each calibration point. Calibration was
repeated until this criterion was met.
Once calibration was successful, participants were instructed via
the computer screen to view the images naturally, as if they were
watching television. The only constraint was that they were to view
the images at all times during each trial. Importantly, all instructions emphasized that the study was measuring associations
between pupil dilation (a secondary measure that was not relevant
to this study) and emotional images. Tracking of eye movements
was not mentioned in order to minimize demand effects. Further,
participants were instructed to look at the ﬁxation cross prior to
each trial in order to standardize the starting location of their gaze.
The experimenter (located in an adjacent room) then monitored
the stimulus presentation and eye tracking throughout each trial.
Data analysis plan
Our primary analysis examined whether depression groups
differentially attended to each stimulus category over time. To do
so, we divided each 30 s trial into six 5-s segments. Within each 5-s
segment we computed percent time attending to each stimulus
category. We then used a mixed-plot ANOVA to examine whether
depression groups differentially attended to stimuli from each
category over time. Secondary analyses examined whether
depression groups differentially attended to stimuli category across
several additional eye tracking outcomes: (a) number of ﬁxations
per category, (b) mean glance duration, and (c) location of ﬁrst
ﬁxation.
Results
Percent time attending to stimuli
A 6 (time segment: 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30)  4
(stimulus valence: dysphoric, threat, positive, neutral)  2(depression
group: MDD, ND) mixed-plot analysis of variance examined whether
depression group was associated with differential attention to stimuli
category over time. Analyses indicated a signiﬁcant main effect for
valence, F(3, 174) ¼ 11.47, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.17, that was qualiﬁed by
a valence  depression group interaction, F(3, 174) ¼ 3.21, p ¼ 0.03,
h2 ¼ 0.05. There was also a signiﬁcant main effect for time,
F(5, 290) ¼ 11.62, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.18, that was qualiﬁed by a valence  time interaction, F(15, 870) ¼ 2.92, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.05. The
time  depression group, F(5, 290) ¼ 1.21, p ¼ 0.32, h2 ¼ 0.02, and
valence  time  depression group, F(15, 870) ¼ 1.21, p ¼ 0.26,
h2 ¼ 0.02, interactions were not statistically signiﬁcant.4
We examined the signiﬁcant stimuli valence  depression group
interaction by comparing depression groups within each stimulus
category. The depressed group spent a signiﬁcantly greater
percentage of time attending to dysphoric stimuli, F(1, 58) ¼ 7.83,
p ¼ 0.007, h2 ¼ 0.12 and less time attending to positive stimuli,
F(1, 58) ¼ 4.92, p ¼ 0.03, h2 ¼ 0.08, than never-depressed participants (see Table 1). There were no group differences for threatening

We completed this same analysis controlling for anxiety symptoms measured
with the total score on the BAI. Anxiety symptoms did not signiﬁcantly interact
with any of the main effects or interactions in the previous analysis (Fs < 1, ns).
Further, although the previously observed interaction between depression group
status and stimulus valence was attenuated somewhat, F(3, 162) ¼ 1.70, p ¼ 0.16,
which is not surprising given the strong correlation between the BAI and BDI
(r ¼ 0.8), the form of the interaction was very similar to analyses without the BAI
covariate. Therefore, anxiety symptoms do not appear to be primarily responsible
for the observed effects for depression group status.

stimuli, F(1, 58) ¼ 0.06, p ¼ 0.82, h2 ¼ 0.00, and neutral stimuli,
F(1, 54) ¼ 0.00, p ¼ 0.99, h2 ¼ 0.00. The absence of a signiﬁcant
stimuli valence  depression group  time interaction suggests
that the observed group differences for dysphoric and positive
stimuli did not signiﬁcantly change over time.
We also examined the time  valence interaction by examining
change over time within each stimulus category (see Fig. 2). For
dysphoric stimuli, there was no signiﬁcant effect for time,
F(5, 295) ¼ 1.71, p ¼ 0.13, h2 ¼ 0.03; attention towards dysphoric
stimuli was relatively stable over time. For threatening stimuli,
there were signiﬁcant linear, F(1, 59) ¼ 28.19, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.32,
quadratic, F(1, 59) ¼ 5.78, p ¼ 0.02, h2 ¼ 0.09, and cubic, F(1, 59) ¼
4.35, p ¼ 0.04, h2 ¼ 0.07, effects for time. Attention to threatening
stimuli strongly decreased over time; however, this linear decrease
was attenuated somewhat during the middle segment of the trial.
Attention to positive stimuli had a signiﬁcant linear, F(1, 59) ¼ 7.12,
p ¼ 0.01, h2 ¼ 0.11, and quadratic, F(1, 59) ¼ 5.17, p ¼ 0.03, h2 ¼ 0.08,
association with time; percent time attending to positive stimuli
increased over time but then decreased towards the end of the trial.
Percent time attending to neutral stimuli had a signiﬁcant linear
association with time, F(1, 59) ¼ 10.45, p ¼ 0.002, h2 ¼ 0.15; attention towards neutral stimuli increased over time.
Percent ﬁxations per stimulus category
A 4 (valence: dysphoric, threat, positive, neutral)  2 (depression group: depressed, never-depressed) mixed-plot ANOVA
examined whether depression groups differed in percentage of
ﬁxations per stimulus category. There was a signiﬁcant valence
effect, F(3, 174) ¼ 10.05, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.15, and a signiﬁcant
valence  group interaction, F(3, 174) ¼ 2.60, p ¼ 0.05, h2 ¼ 0.04.
Follow-up simple effects between group comparisons revealed that
the depressed groups had a signiﬁcantly greater percentage of
ﬁxations for dysphoric stimuli, F(1, 58) ¼ 8.33, p ¼ 0.005, h2 ¼ 0.13,
and marginally fewer ﬁxations for positive stimuli, F(1, 58) ¼ 3.50,
p ¼ 0.06, h2 ¼ 0.06, than never-depressed participants (see Table 1).
No group differences were observed for threat, F(1, 58) ¼ 0.88,
p ¼ 0.88, h2 ¼ 0.00, or neutral stimuli, F(1, 58) ¼ 0.21, p ¼ 0.65,
h2 ¼ 0.00.
Mean glance duration
A 4 (valence: dysphoric, threat, positive, neutral)  2 (depression group: depressed, never-depressed) mixed-plot ANOVA
examined whether depression groups differed in glance duration
(i.e., mean ﬁxation duration) by stimulus category. Analyses indicated a non-signiﬁcant effect for valence, F(3, 174) ¼ 0.97, p ¼ 0.41,
h2 ¼ 0.02, and a non-signiﬁcant valence  depression group interaction, F(3, 174) ¼ 1.06, p ¼ 0.37, h2 ¼ 0.02. Mean glance duration for
depressed and never-depressed participants did not signiﬁcantly
differ across stimulus categories (see Table 1).
Location of ﬁrst ﬁxation
A 4 (valence: dysphoric, threat, positive, neutral)  2 (depression group: depressed, never-depressed) mixed-plot ANOVA
examined whether depression groups differed in location of ﬁrst
ﬁxation across stimulus categories. Analyses revealed a signiﬁcant
main effect for valence, F(3, 174) ¼ 8.32, p < 0.001, h2 ¼ 0.13, and
a non-signiﬁcant interaction between valence and depression
group, F(3, 174) ¼ 0.25, p ¼ 0.86, h2 ¼ 0.00. LSD follow-up comparisons indicated that participants’ ﬁrst ﬁxations were more likely to
be directed towards threat and positive stimuli than neutral and
dysphoric stimuli (ps < 0.05). Likelihood of ﬁrst ﬁxation being
directed towards threat stimuli and positive stimuli did not differ
(p ¼ 0.16).

Discussion
We examined selective attention for emotional stimuli in clinically depressed and never depressed young adults. Uniquely, we
also examined the unfolding of selective attention over time in
these two groups. Depressed individuals spent more time
attending to dysphoric stimuli than their never depressed counterparts. This group difference was relatively consistent over the
course of the 30-s trial; that is, time did not moderate the association between depression group status and stimulus valence.
The number of ﬁxations directed at dysphoric stimuli, rather
than longer glance durations, appeared to be responsible for the
depression group differences in total time spent viewing dysphoric
images. This repeated turning of attention towards the dysphoric
stimuli likely reﬂects sustained or elaborative processing of the
stimuli. Each ﬁxation represents a relatively small proportion of
each stimulus; repeated ﬁxations within a stimulus may be
required to comprehensively process the image. In contrast, the
never depressed group spent signiﬁcantly more time attending to
and had a greater number of ﬁxations for positive stimuli than
depressed participants, suggesting more sustained processing of
the positive images among the never depressed group. Finally,
there were no group differences for location of ﬁrst ﬁxation. All
participants tended to initially view the threatening and positive
images more often than dysphoric or neutral images.
These ﬁndings are consistent with cognitive models (e.g., Beck,
1976), which posit that depressed individuals display biased
attention for dysphoric stimuli. Our study provides an important
replication of the only other eye tracking study to examine biased
attention in a sample of clinically depressed individuals. Taken
together, these studies provide a robust demonstration of depressed

individuals’ biased attention for dysphoric information and loss of
bias for positive information that characterizes never-depressed
individuals. More importantly, however, our study expands upon
previous work by demonstrating that these group differences are
sustained; that is, they are relatively consistent over time. The vast
majority of research has examined information processing biases
among depressed individuals early (e.g., < 1500 ms) in the processing of emotional stimuli. We examined the course of processing
over a 30-s trial (30,000 ms) and found that depressed individuals
more consistently attended to dysphoric stimuli than their neverdepressed counterparts. This evidence further bolsters the argument that sustained processing of dysphoric stimuli likely
contributes to the maintenance of major depressive disorder.
This study also provides a relatively strong test of biased processing because dysphoric stimuli were presented simultaneously
with other emotional stimuli. Most prior research has examined
processing biases with pairs of stimuli (e.g., neutral-emotional
word pairs). Our data suggest that the presentation of emotionally
evocative stimuli does not disrupt biased attention for dysphoric
stimuli – depressed individuals attend to dysphoric stimuli even in
the presence of other emotional information including other
negative information (i.e., threat stimuli).
Although depressed individuals show speciﬁc differences in
their processing of dysphoric and positive stimuli, these differences
were not evident in the very earliest stages of information processing. There were no group differences for which stimulus category participants viewed ﬁrst. Whereas anxious individuals show
a tendency to orient their eye movements towards threat stimuli
(Mogg, Millar, & Bradley, 2000), results from this and other (Caseras
et al., 2007) work suggest that depressed individuals do not show
such a bias.
Information processing biases are thus more likely to occur in
the elaborative stages of information processing. This is consistent
with other research which has shown that depressed individuals
tend to ruminate about dysphoric topics (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000),
have more difﬁculty inhibiting dysphoric stimuli (Goeleven, De
Raedt, Baert, & Koster, 2006), and experience more intrusive
negative thoughts (Beevers, Wenzlaff, Hayes, & Scott, 1999). It may
be that anxiety is characterized by vigilance for threat-related
stimuli in the early stages of processing followed by the avoidance
of threatening stimuli (Rinck & Becker, 2006), whereas depression
involves processing biases during more elaborative stages of
information processing (Mogg & Bradley, 2005). Future work
should examine whether difﬁculty disengaging attention underlies
this sustained processing bias in depression (e.g., Koster, De Raedt,
Goeleven, Franck, & Crombez, 2005).
Several limitations of this study should be noted. We studied
young adults, which limits generalizability to older depressed
populations. Although we conducted clinical interviews to diagnose
major depressive disorder, we did not complete full SCID interviews
(i.e., only the Mood Disorders Module). Therefore, it is possible that
participants may have had other undiagnosed disorders. Our
sample size for the depressed group was also relatively small,
although it was more than twice the size of the only other eye

tracking study of selective attention with clinically depressed
participants (Eizenman et al., 2003). Larger sample sizes in future
work will allow for more statistical power to detect smaller differences in attentional biases over time. Finally, although the use of
complex images that vary in content may have reduced our
experimental control somewhat, they do have the added beneﬁt of
increased realism and perhaps generalizability.
In conclusion, the current study suggests that depressed young
adults signiﬁcantly differ from their never depressed counterparts
in how they attend to emotional information. Depressed individuals are more likely to attend to dysphoric images and less likely to
attend to positive images than never depressed people. The current
results also suggest that these biases are sustained over relatively
long periods of time. That is, there were no signiﬁcant effects for
time, suggesting that the biases were evident throughout the
majority of each 30-s trial. Given these results, future longitudinal
research is needed to determine whether sustained processing of
dysphoric information is associated with time to depression
remission and whether it increases vulnerability for experiencing
a depressive episode. We believe that eye tracking methodology
may provide a sensitive and robust assessment of biased processing
that is ideal for this important work.
