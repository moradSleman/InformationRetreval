The growing use of difficult-to-parse algorithmic systems in the production of news, from algorithmic curation to automated writing and news bots, problematizes the normative turn
toward transparency as a key tenet of journalism ethics. Pragmatic guidelines that facilitate
algorithmic transparency are needed. This research presents a focus group study that engaged
50 participants across the news media and academia to discuss case studies of algorithms in
news production and elucidate factors that are amenable to disclosure. Results indicate numerous opportunities to disclose information about an algorithmic system across layers such as
the data, model, inference, and interface. Findings underscore the deeply entwined roles of
human actors in such systems as well as challenges to adoption of algorithmic transparency
including the dearth of incentives for organizations and the concern for overwhelming endusers with a surfeit of transparency information.

Introduction
The direct and indirect influences of digital technologies on the news media have
been widely documented. Many newspapers have suffered or disappeared entirely as
the former business model of classifieds, advertising, and subscriptions became less
tenable in an online environment (Meyer 2006). News outlets overall had to adopt production methods that included more of an audience and online focus, which led to
more interactive news features (Boczkowski 2005; Deuze 2005). Scholars have argued
that the increased digitization and interactivity in online news, through hyperlinks, sourcing and document disclosure, and social media and audience comments, have contributed to greater openness or transparency in journalism (Bennett 2014; Deuze 2005;
Karlsson 2010, 2011). Journalism ethics are evolving to incorporate transparency as a
key value. Educational and professional organizations, such as the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), the Poynter Institute, and the Radio Television Digital News
Association (RTDNA), have all adopted transparency as a new core value for professional journalists (McBride and Rosenstiel 2014; RTDNA 2015; SPJ 2014). The elevation
of transparency to a new central standard in journalism has also been fueled by the
belief that transparency could remedy the loss in credibility and trust (Hayes, Singer,
and Ceppos 2007; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014; Plaisance 2007) the news media has
experienced in the recent past (Pew 2012).

NICHOLAS DIAKOPOULOS AND MICHAEL KOLISKA

Deuze (2005, 455) defines transparency as the “ways in which people both inside
and external to journalism are given a chance to monitor, check, criticize and even
intervene in the journalistic process.” Transparency allows audiences to see more of the
news production process1 and the journalists behind the news stories. However, such
transparency is problematized by the adoption of computational journalism and the
integration of algorithmic components, products, or platforms that help scale and optimize news production, curation, and dissemination (Diakopoulos, forthcoming). Such
algorithmic systems challenge the norm of transparency due to the opacity in their
automated decision-making capabilities (Diakopoulos 2015).
Computational Journalism—defined here as finding, telling, and disseminating
news stories with, by, or about algorithms is being adopted in a number of ways by the
news media. One aspect of this is automated journalism—also sometimes referred to
as “algorithmic journalism” (Dörr 2016)—which employs software or algorithms with little human intervention to generate news stories for everything from crime reporting,
to earthquake alerts and company earnings reports (Graefe 2016). The Associated Press
employs such news writing software to automatically produce thousands of news stories on sports and financial topics (Associated Press 2015). Other platforms such as
Yahoo or the Big Ten Network also increasingly rely on algorithms to produce game
recaps for basketball and football games (Narrative Science n.d.) or fantasy-football stories (Yahoo n.d.). The Los Angeles Times was among the first to use an algorithm to
report on an earthquake in 2014 (Oremus 2014), and used algorithmic reporting tools
to produce short posts for their homicide blog as early as 2010 (Young and Hermida
2015). Besides automated journalism, the broader field of computational journalism
suggests other ways in which algorithms are infusing the news media. For instance,
simulations and data-driven predictions are now finding their way into news reports on
topics like politics, finance, or public health. The New York Times, as well as BuzzFeed
and Mashable all use algorithms in various ways to decide which news content will be
distributed (and when) via social media (Albeanu 2015; Nguyen, Kelleher, and Kelleher
2015; Wang 2015). Journalistic tasks like finding and verifying sources and content on
social media are increasingly taking advantage of algorithmically driven tools that can
help cope with the issues of scale (Park et al. 2016; Thurman et al. 2016). News outlets
also increasingly use algorithms in A/B testing of headlines and computational journalism is being deployed directly on social media and other platforms using news bots—
automated agents that participate in news and information dissemination (Lokot and
Diakopoulos 2016). These examples are just a sampling of the myriad ways that algorithmic approaches to content are infusing the news media.
As algorithms become more entrenched in the way the news media works, algorithmic transparency is in a nascent stage and has yet to develop an accepted standard
of how and when it should be employed. It oftentimes manifests in computational and
data journalism as an effort to help the public understand the methods used in the
process of reporting a data-driven story. For instance, ProPublica has published white
papers describing statistical methodologies with some of its investigations (Grochowski
Jones and Ornstein 2016) and BuzzFeed, FiveThirtyEight, and other news organizations
maintain repositories on Github where they open-source their data and code used in
some (but not all) data-driven articles. The New York Times maintains a blog called
“Open” that publishes technical articles about how some of its news technologies, such
as its recommendation engine, operate. Other news organizations, like the BBC, have

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

published academic papers to describe the details of some of their algorithmic tools
(Shearer, Simon, and Geiger 2014).
The research presented in this paper is a first attempt to reconcile the increasing
use of algorithms in the news media with a desire to enable transparency as a route to
accountability (Ward 2014). Transparency is just one approach toward the ethics and
accountability of algorithms (Dörr and Hollnbuchner 2016), however, it is gaining traction as a norm and practice within the industry, and is thus the focus of our study. In
particular we ask: how exactly might the news media become transparent about the
algorithms it uses in news production? We are explicitly interested in developing a palette of information disclosure options regarding algorithms so that professional journalists have a set of tangible considerations as they approach algorithmic transparency in
different institutional and news production contexts. To do so we analyze the results of
nine focus groups comprised of media practitioners and researchers from leading
national news outlets and universities in the United States. Participants discussed three
case studies that describe concrete uses of algorithms in the media including automated news writing, algorithmic curation, and simulation in storytelling. This research
proposes a framework for algorithmic transparency—what we define as the disclosure of
information about algorithms to enable monitoring, checking, criticism, or intervention by
interested parties. Results indicate opportunities for information disclosure about algorithms across four key areas: data, model, inference, and interface. Moreover, the findings reinforce the complex interplay of human decisions that become embedded in
such systems, and underline the potential implications of more transparency for news
organizations. This article aims to inform both scholars and practitioners by raising
awareness for algorithmic transparency and considering effective ways to inform news
media audiences about algorithmic processes. Though focused on algorithms in the
professional news media, the framework that we develop and present may also be
applicable to uses of algorithms in other domains across government and industry.

Transparency
Transparency has become an important value in today’s society from governance
and businesses to journalism and computer sciences (Schudson 2015). Even though
transparency is not a new concept for holding governments and institutions accountable, its recent renaissance has been accompanied by changes in communication technologies (Fung, Graham, and Weil 2007). The internet and the growing number of
digital communication devices make storing, accessing, and analyzing information
about organizations and individuals increasingly easy (Bennis 2013). Digital technologies
have changed the access to and scrutiny of information by anyone with internet access,
which Meijer (2009) broadly described as “computer-mediated transparency.”
Transparency is generally considered a means to see the truth and motives
behind people’s actions (Balkin 1999) and to ensure social accountability and trust
(Breton 2006). On a very basic level, transparency allows access to more information
which can influence power relationships between governments and citizens, business
and customers, and in our case between news outlets and audiences (Bennis 2013).
The access to more information also reduces uncertainty in social relations and
theoretically increases trust (Cotterrell 1999), which is crucial in the maintenance of a

functional society (Fukuyama 1995). But while transparency can be seen as beneficial to
engendering trust, seeing the inner workings of a government, business, or newsroom
can result in negative implications such as undermining competitive advantages or
creating costs without concomitant gains (Granados and Gupta 2013).

Transparency and the News Media
With a growing culture of transparency in society and a decline of trust in the
news media, news organizations have turned to transparency as a way to open up
news production processes to the public (Craft and Heim 2009). The New York Times
public editor Margaret Sullivan (2013) declared that The Times embraces transparency
through social media, Web-based chats with journalists, and through the public editor
who advocates for readers. According to Allen, the implementation of such transparency mechanisms in the news media has two major functions:
[I]t is an important part of the discovery of social truth, but it is also a way to gain
access to the truth about the manufacturing of news. For journalists, transparency
functions as a system of accountability and as a way of increasing legitimacy with citizens, both key institutional values. (Allen 2008, 324)

Transparency in the news media can thus be understood as an ethical principal for
journalists (Plaisance 2007) and as a means to create positive perceptions of journalism
(Karlsson 2010). Supporters of transparency see it as a solution to major problems journalism is facing today, such as the decline in journalistic authority (Singer 2007) and
the loss of credibility in the news media (Hayes, Singer, and Ceppos 2007). Kovach and
Rosenstiel (2014, 291) suggest transparency “gives the public a basis on which to judge
whether a particular kind of journalism is the kind they wish to encourage and trust.”
Transparency has been described as “the new objectivity” (Weinberger 2009), a better
form of truthtelling (Singer 2007), and as an opportunity to show that professional journalistic content is superior to non-professional content (Karlsson 2011).
Transparency includes the disclosure of errors and failures, which is thought to
build trust (Silverman 2013). Yet, Broersma (2013) argues journalism would lose its
authoritative voice by divulging shortcomings. It would ultimately invite doubt into its
own discourse and break its paradigm. “That is why pleas for transparency about
choices underlying reporting and admitting that reports, at best, temporarily resemble
truth, subvert journalism” (33).
While most of the discussions around transparency in the news media are normative, research has shown that many journalists have not yet embraced transparency
(Chadha and Koliska 2014) and prefer objectivity as a guiding journalistic principal (Hellmueller, Vos, and Poepsel 2013). Research has not yet found strong evidence that transparency affects news audiences’ credibility perceptions (Karlsson, Clerwall, and Nord
2014; Roberts 2007). Yet, transparency has been elevated to a core normative ethic of
journalism culture in the United States (RTDNA 2015; SPJ 2014). Moreover, outside
norms from open-source culture are impacting computational and data journalism in
particular, creating support for the shift toward transparency that includes open-source
programming, open data, and public involvement in news production (Coddington
2015; Lewis and Usher 2013).

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

Beyond normative ethical considerations, news organizations may also consider
transparency as a strategic business practice. Holtz and Havens (2009) argue that showing how companies do things has become more important than what they actually
produce. Corporations increasingly open up by publishing Corporate Social Responsibility reports (Owen 2005) to improve their reputation by suggesting that they are “doing
well by doing good” (Fombrun 2005). Tapscott and Ticoll (2003) argue that transparency has become a force that businesses cannot afford to ignore as responsible
behavior and business integrity driven by transparency makes economic sense. On a
practical level, this includes accessibility to leaders, disclosure of success and failures,
and the promotion of ethical behavior. Granados and Gupta (2013) suggest that disclosure options such as distortion, bias, or concealment can be strategically employed.
Strategic or managed transparency may not always be a genuine attempt to be truthful
but can be used to create the appearance and perception of trustworthiness.

Algorithmic Transparency
News organizations are increasingly employing algorithms in the production of
news to gather, organize, make sense of, create, and disseminate stories (Diakopoulos,
forthcoming). Such technology enables scale and offers a competitive advantage for
the business in producing content more efficiently. But what is good for business creates tension with the normative call for transparency since such “black boxes” often
lack explainability in their automated decision making (Diakopoulos 2015). One of the
main concerns regarding computational systems is the existence of embedded biases,
which researchers have long criticized (Friedman and Nissenbaum 1996). These values,
biases, or ideologies (Mager 2012) can create consequences for the formation of publics
and the fair and unbiased provision of information (Gillespie 2014).
The notion of algorithmic transparency in the news media is an attempt to articulate the mechanisms by which information about algorithms may be made public. Disclosing information about how algorithms drive various computational systems would
allow users to determine the values, biases or ideologies in operation in order to understand underlying points of view of a news product. McBride and Rosenstiel (2014)
argue that transparency is ideal for a news environment that increasingly fosters journalism with a point of view. In other words, as long as biases are made public for audiences to evaluate, journalism would still fulfill its mission.
Individual studies have examined the role of information disclosure and explanation of specific algorithms in recommendation systems (Cramer et al. 2008; Schaffer
et al. 2015; Tintarev and Masthoff 2007), personalization (El-Arini et al. 2012), ranking
(Diakopoulos, Cass, and Romero 2014), or scoring (Kizilcec 2016). Results show that
transparent explanations in recommender systems can serve to enhance acceptance of
specific recommendations (Cramer et al. 2008) and improve a user’s impression of recommendation quality, but also diminish the user experience (Schaffer et al. 2015). Moreover, expectation violation, which is thought to drive additional information seeking,
was found to be a moderator in the effect of procedural transparency on increased trust
(Kizilcec 2016). In this research we do not focus on specific technicalities around a particular algorithm, but rather explore information disclosure around a range of algorithms in
the news media, including broader impacts on end-users and news organizations.

A Study of Algorithmic Transparency in the Media
In order to better understand the challenges and tensions surrounding algorithmic transparency, we convened 50 participants from the news media and academia to
discuss three different case studies relating to the use of algorithms in the media. Nine
focus groups considered the cases and generated a wide array of ideas relating to what
might be disclosed about algorithms as well as the feasibility, potential impact, and
other ramifications of disclosure. This exploratory study is a first attempt to examine
the varied challenges surrounding algorithmic transparency in the news media. For this
purpose, this research seeks the answer to three questions:
RQ1: What elements of algorithms could be made public?

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

RQ2: What are the limitations of algorithmic transparency?
RQ3: What are possible comprehensive disclosure mechanisms for algorithmic transparency?

Study Methodology
Participants. Fifty participants were invited to a one-day long set of focus groups
on the topic of algorithmic transparency in the media. Participants were selected based
on their public reputation and knowledge of computational journalism and use of algorithms in the news media. Participants were not compensated, though some were
granted travel stipends. In an effort to commingle practitioner and scholarly perspectives, 28 participants were representatives of industry and 22 came from academia. Academic participants came from North American universities and included disciplinary
experts from journalism studies or computational journalism, information science, and
computer science (e.g. from Columbia, Stanford, New York University, Northeastern,
Rutgers, City University of New York, University of Maryland, Harvard, Princeton, etc.).
Industry participants primarily included reporters and editors who had worked on computational or data journalism projects (e.g. from The New York Times, Washington Post,
Texas Tribune, NPR, Boston Globe, Associated Press, etc.), but also included data scientists or product managers working for news organizations or for technology companies
creating information products (e.g. from CNN, Mashable, Vocativ, SmartNews, Chartbeat,
Bloomberg, etc.). Individuals from several of the major technology and platform providers relevant to the field such as Facebook, Twitter, and Automated Insights were
invited and either declined to participate or did not respond to the invitation.
Stimuli. Three case studies (CS) were developed to address diverse aspects of
how algorithms are currently used in the professional news media to aid in content creation, organization/curation, and dissemination. These included automatically generated
news content (CS1); algorithmically enhanced curation (CS2); and simulation, prediction,
and modeling in storytelling (CS3). CS1 dealt largely with the use of automatic writing
software such as that created by companies like Automated Insights or Narrative
Science to produce news texts from structured data. CS2 focused on the use of algorithms to select, curate, recommend, and personalize content streams like the Facebook
newsfeed, including algorithmically generated news homepages, and the use of
algorithms to rank and curate social media comments on news sites. Finally, CS3

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

focused on the use of simulation and modeling in news stories, including examples
such as political prediction models or models presented as interactive data visualizations. One page of background information about each of these case studies was provided to participants before and during the workshop to stimulate the elicitation of
factors that might be made transparent about algorithms. The handout included a brief
explanation of the technological processes involved in the various case studies to provide a common knowledge base for all participants.

Procedure and Methods
Focus groups were conducted for each case in order to gather data about knowledge, attitudes, and practices (Puchta and Potter 2004) from different perspectives and
to stimulate interactivity, participation, and group insights (Morgan 1996). As algorithmic transparency is a highly specialized issue we sampled participants with a similar
professional background to garner detailed expert opinions (Kemper, Stringfield, and
Teddlie 2003).
Participants were broken into three facilitator/moderator-led subgroups of 14–18.
Larger groups were chosen for logistical reasons and because fairly large groups elicit a
wide range of responses (Morgan 1996). Moderators included the authors of this paper
as well as another researcher at the institute where the focus groups were hosted.
Groups spent about an hour considering each case study. After each session, groups
were randomly mixed, ensuring that no individual participated in the same case study
twice. Moderators first provided examples and questions to elicit an interactive discussion on the various aspects that could be disclosed about algorithms. Ideas for information disclosure about the algorithms presented were solicited, gathered, and displayed
to collectively categorize and typologize the various viewpoints. Finally, the groups discussed ramifications related to manipulation, cost, and presentation of the potentially
disclosed information. All participants re-convened at the end of the three focus group
sessions and were debriefed as one larger group.
Each discussion was transcribed in real-time by stenographers that were
instructed to leave any identifying information such as names or affiliations out of the
transcripts. Participants were made aware that transcripts would be anonymized for
analysis. We analyzed the nine transcriptions (three case studies three sessions each)
through iterative qualitative code, affinity diagramming, typologizing, and memoing
(Lofland and Lofland 1994). Open coding of participants’ statements in the context of
the overall conversations resulted in a codebook that was iteratively refined. All three
CS1 sessions were coded independently by each of two researchers and discrepancies
in the application of codes were discussed until consensus was reached. The first session of each of the remaining two case studies was coded by both researchers and discussed to resolve discrepancies. Then, one researcher coded the final two sessions of
CS2 and the other of CS3.

Study Findings
Iterative analysis of the case study transcripts resulted in the emergence of an
empirically grounded typology. By considering the three cases in conjunction, the

NICHOLAS DIAKOPOULOS AND MICHAEL KOLISKA

typology covers a wider set of issues than if we had considered each case in isolation.
Moreover, our findings suggest substantial overlaps of transparency issues across all
three cases albeit with some cases exposing various issues more saliently than others.
The typology recognizes the distinct roles but also deep entanglements of humans and
algorithms that must be teased out in order to achieve transparency around real-world
systems that so tightly weave humans and machines together. Participants pointed out
that as human creations, algorithms involve human design decisions at many levels
that may need to be disclosed. The typology organizes findings according to an input–
output framework across four distinct phases. These phases reflect the pipeline of information as it ultimately moves toward an end-user and include: data (inputs), model
(transformation), inference (output), and interface (output). Findings also show consequences of disclosure of various types of information. In the following subsections we
detail the types of information participants deemed important to disclose about
human–algorithm systems in the news media, and summarize these findings in Table 1.
We do not attribute specific statements to individuals, but where appropriate indicate
the case study, e.g. CS2.

Humans and Algorithms
Human involvement is essential to the design and ongoing functioning of algorithmic systems. At a high level transparency might involve explaining the goal, purpose, or intent of a given algorithm, including editorial goals that articulate rationale
for the selection, inclusion, exclusion, or optimization of various inputs or outputs to
the algorithm. Focus group participants frequently pointed out that the way different
actors are integrated into the overall process should be made transparent in some
cases. For automatically generated news articles (CS1), labeling whether a human editor
had reviewed the output before publication was seen as informative for determining
the credibility of a news product. Similarly, participants wanted to know the identity of
the people that have control over an algorithmic system, oversee it, or are accountable
for it. Authors or designers of such systems could be made public similarly to journalists’ bylines. While it may be difficult to disambiguate and assign credit or blame in
large collective efforts (Nissenbaum 1996), such disclosure could serve to reward individuals’ reputations and exert social pressure toward normative behavior. In some cases
an organization may buy software rather than create it, implying that the human
involvement for that organization is not the algorithm design or coding but rather its
configuration and parameterization—an aspect several participants suggested could
also be disclosed. Other potential avenues for transparency that were discussed
included describing the social or cultural context of algorithm development, the temporal evolution including how and why adjustments are made over time, as well as
human-intuited “fudge factors” that are sometimes added by people to make algorithmic outputs line up better with expectations. A participant summed up several disclosable human-oriented facets that came up repeatedly in the discussion: “Things like who
made it, what was the thinking behind it, what human oversight sits atop the algorithmic decisions, what are the assumptions underlying the algorithms, are there hard
coded rules…” (CS2).

Given the difficulty in clearly delineating human influences in algorithmic systems,
a topic for discussion by participants became the algorithmic presence—whether and
when an algorithmic process was being employed at all. Participants wanted transparency when personalization algorithms were adapting a user’s view of a content
stream. “I kind of want to know if I’m always being watched or sometimes being
watched or not being watched at all,” remarked one participant in CS2 with regards to
how personalization algorithms might be “watching” their activities. The idea of an “algorithm at work” badge or icon for content curated or personalized by an algorithm
was suggested.
The automatic generation of news content (CS1) sparked a number of comments
that touched on the different expectations for transparency depending on whether a
human or an algorithm had generated the content. As one participant adroitly put it:
“We have retractions and corrections all the time when they are human-ran stories. I
think it is worth discussing what is the baseline here and what are we expecting of
algorithms that we don’t expect of human writers?” (CS1). On the other hand, “One
bad journalist can put out four, five terrible misrepresented articles in a day but an
algorithm can put out a thousand,” noted another participant (CS1). Several participants
pointed out if a human reporter makes a mistake you can fire them or chastise them
to get them to improve. For algorithmic systems such feedback is more complicated as

it must be channeled back to engineers who may make changes that in turn need to
be re-validated.

Input–Output Pipeline

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

Algorithms work on various levels in producing, curating, or managing information. The input–output pipeline describes crucial stages and aspects of information that
are fed into a system (data), transformed (model), output as a classification or predicted
score (inference), and presented to the end-user (interface). Keeping in mind our underlying goal of enumerating the range of potential pieces of information to disclose
around algorithms, in the subsections below we describe all four aspects and how
information about them may be disclosed.
Data. Algorithmic systems have an undeniable dependency on data, which
drives applications like machine learning, personalization, simulation, and automatically
written stories. Focus group discussions highlighted some key dimensions that may be
disclosed about an algorithmic system including the information quality and validity of
the data feeding that system. Specifically, this includes variables such as data accuracy,
uncertainty (e.g. error margins), timeliness (e.g. when was the data collected), completeness or missing elements, sampling method, provenance (e.g. sources), and volume
(e.g. of training data used in machine learning), as well as assumptions or limitations
inherent to the data collection. Participants also wanted to see how data has been
transformed, vetted, cleaned, or otherwise edited (either automatically or by people).
Discussants indicated that such transparency information should take the form of textual descriptions in addition to disclosure of the data itself. Metadata about the data
was also deemed useful to inform decisions about raw data disclosure such as if the
data stems from public or private sources, or includes personally identifying information. Participants were particularly interested to know about the datafication of their
user activity and how it influences the end product, “You want to see the data profile
that they’re using on you that the algorithm is reacting to” (CS2). It was suggested that
transparency of such information would have the added benefit of allowing users to
correct information that was incorrect in their personal profile.
Many of the factors of potential disclosure noted above are essential to the functioning of the algorithmic system and are rooted in human processes such as how the
data was chosen, collected, sourced, or sampled. Since algorithmic systems rely on
quantification of the world in order to operate, human processes are needed to set the
ground rules, definitions, and boundaries of that quantification in order to enable algorithmic operation at scale. As such, transparency information surrounding the data
would necessarily need to consider the human influences on that data.
Model. The model itself as well as the modeling process and methodology are
essential aspects of the algorithmic system that discussants suggested could be disclosed. Modeling involves building a simplified or optimized reality of the world, often
using data and a process that predicts, ranks, associates, or classifies. A key aspect of
any model that may be disclosed is the input scheme—the features or variables used
by the algorithm. Participants wanted to know what exactly the model is optimizing,
how different features are weighted, what type of the model was built (e.g. linear

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

versus non-linear), and what software modeling tools were used since these embed different assumptions or limitations. For models trained on data, transparency around that
data as enumerated above would provide a more complete picture of the model. While
some participants talked about optimization functions and machine learning features,
others in the groups saw such factors more as editorial criteria. For example, thresholds
that are used by a model in determining the semantics of output for an automated
writing algorithm might determine the interpretation of a value, i.e. whether a predicted value is a “moderate increase” or a “dramatic rise.” The thresholds matter for the
eventual interpretation of the output text by end-users.
Participants repeatedly mentioned source code as a potential avenue for transparency around the modeling process, “I want to see the source code for your data
pipeline. I want to see the source code for your visual presentation,” and “we could do
pseudo-code as a way of interpreting for the public” (CS3). In effect, the code (and its
revision history) is the artifactual output that reifies the modeling process, thus providing a vital trace of how that process works from inputs, to transformations, and eventual outputs. At the same time, code was discussed as a difficult technical description
limiting the usability of such information for the broader public.
Participants recognized that much of the work in modeling ties back into human
efforts, including the rationale for weightings or choice of model, the inclusion or exclusion of variables in the final model, the model validation procedure, and assumptions
(statistical or otherwise) made in the process. This may also include how models evolve
over time, “how did the models then learn from previous iterations, does the 2014
model differ from the 2012 and what do they learn from 2012 and incorporate into
2014?” (CS3). A challenge for algorithmic transparency comes back to the ambiguity of
whether a decision is human-made or a result of an algorithmic optimization: “distinguishing between hand-coded rules and [machine] learned things” (CS2). There are two
distinct avenues for transparency, one concerning the editorial human influences and
decisions in modeling and methodology, and the other concerning how those editorial
choices are implemented in code. There was a belief by some participants that such editorial decisions in the modeling process would lead to deeper insights about the news
organization: “I personally [would] love to see what’s been left out, rejected, because
that would give a huge insight into the mindset of the news organization” (CS3).
Inference. Output inferences made via an algorithmic process, such as classifications, numerical predictions, or recommendations, often raised questions about error
rates, uncertainty, and accuracy. Discussants acknowledged that much could be learned
from understanding an algorithm’s performance on outliers as well as typical cases. In
terms of the Facebook newsfeed algorithm, one participant remarked, “the algorithm is
making assumptions about who you’re closest to or what content you want to see and
those inferences may not be completely accurate” (CS2). It was suggested that transparency around inferences should include not only accuracy but also what types of
inferences are being made at all.
In addition to disclosing summary statistics, study participants proposed that further error analysis around inferences could include detailing protocols for remediating
errors, as well as characterizing error sources such as if they stem from human, data, or
algorithm. Moreover, it was suggested that since classifiers oftentimes produce a confidence value, such information should also be disclosed in aggregate to indicate the

average range of those confidence values and thus uncertainty in outcomes. Participants pointed out that for users to contextualize such transparency information it
should also include a description of the significance of that uncertainty or how that
uncertainty can be understood or taken into account by the overall process.
Interface. The final layer of output interacts directly with end-users: the interface
that the algorithm portrays to the user. Any transparency information revealed about
an algorithm must ultimately take some “tangible or visual” form in order to be presented to the end-user. Participants discussed options such as integrating information
about an algorithm directly in the user interface by providing cues for clicking into
FAQs to examine issues surrounding data, model, and inferences. Publishing periodic
transparency reports or creating new roles for ombudspeople whose job it would be to
communicate transparency information about algorithms were also proposed. At its
simplest, the “algorithmic presence” could be signaled in the interface through an icon
next to content that had been affected by an algorithmic process, such as personalization.
Participants discussed interactivity as a key mechanism for revealing extra layers
of transparency information, for instance by allowing users to drill into content to see
underlying data: “if you have an automatically written sports story maybe you could
click through and see the box scores” (CS1); or if the transparency information needed
to be a written description: “You could click on something that would give you a FAQ
about that particular algorithm, who programmed it, why it’s making choices that it’s
making … stuff that will be easily digestible for the average consumer” (CS2).
Interactivity can also allow users to perturb and tweak the input to the algorithm
in order to better understand the outputs, or as one participant put it, “how can I interact with the algorithm to get it to treat me differently” (CS2). Users can use that interactivity to contribute to a social sensemaking endeavor around the algorithm: “people
can try different things and they can say, look, I changed this parameter and used a different data-set and I notice that your analysis is biased” (CS3). In personalized systems,
it was suggested this might take the form of allowing users to see how the system
would appear if it were personalized for different archetypes of users.
Another conceptualization of interactivity involved being able to override the
algorithm, to flip it on or off and to see the effect on the results. But participants
pointed out that if the product itself is defined by that algorithm, such as a news recommendation app, an on/off switch would be unfeasible from a business standpoint.
Yet, participants saw interactivity as a route to be able to see and compare the outputs
of an algorithmic system based on whether that algorithm was on or off, or on the
inputs and parameters that the user was changing. Overall, interactivity was seen as a
way to open up some of the editorial decisions about an algorithm for scrutiny.
A tension emerged concerning transparency and information disclosure at the
interface layer. Participants sparred with the idea that by disclosing more information
they would be overloading the user, perhaps ruining the user experience: “The
underlying problems of these algorithms we’re trying to solve is overload and so the
thing that I struggle with is coming up with a way to not add to the overload when
we’re helping people understand” (CS2). Many stressed that transparency information
should be disclosed in a form that is translated for a general public audience, or made
available on demand to those technical readers that really care about the nuts and

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

bolts. But this is a delicate line to walk: “If it’s a blurb, you risk it being too simplified
and people … interpreting it wrong because you weren’t precise enough in the hopes
of being brief” (CS2).
Several focus group participants were skeptical that end-users would even care
about algorithmic transparency, as one participant put it: “if you put yourself in the
average Joe’s shoes, what issue is it that they’re seeing with the algorithms? I’m not
sure…” (CS2). Though this sentiment was balanced by comments from others such as,
“The audience has changed. The audience wants transparency now” (CS1). Another participant (CS2) remarked: “If it’s detailed enough for somebody to understand the
science of algorithms to really use critically, maybe 1 percent of the readership would
be able to use it.” In the case of algorithmic transparency indeed many people may not
actually understand the disclosed information, which raises the challenge of trying to
meet the information needs of diverse users while not “polluting” the user experience
with a surfeit of information for the uninterested.

Consequences and Challenges to Algorithmic Transparency
After participants discussed aspects of algorithms that might be disclosed, they
were prompted by the facilitators to start evaluating those factors along dimensions
such as feasibility of disclosure (technical as well as general feasibility), openness to
manipulation or gaming, cost or effort needed, and mechanism for presentation.
Chief among the moderating factors for more transparency were business issues:
what would motivate a news or media organization to disclose details about their algorithms? Costs identified in producing transparency information included: data preparation, documentation writing, source code polishing, and benchmark testing. “How does
being transparent offset loss of revenue,” remarked one participant in CS2. Other disincentives to transparency pointed out were: privacy issues which might arise from disclosing data that is not properly anonymized, as well as the legal implications of
admitting errors or uncertainties that could open the door for lawsuits. There was some
concern that disclosing uncertainty information might lead readers to think the results
were unreliable: “If I’m a reader and it says we’re 80 percent certain of this, which
might be very legitimate certainty to a scientist but to the reader they’re like, then the
article is useless” (CS3).
Participants also suggested that disclosing aspects of how a proprietary algorithmic system works may hurt an organization’s technological competitive advantage, or
open the system to manipulation by third parties. Yet it was recognized that people
will game the system no matter what, and that by disclosing information publicly it
would level the playing field or, as one participant (CS2) put it, “everybody has the
same chance now because we all know the rules of the game.”
While the business disincentives mentioned were plentiful, no clear and compelling value proposition for an organization to self-motivate and disclose transparency
information about algorithms was proposed. Some suggested that if an organization
started to lose income or users that might be an incentive to disclose information to
help win those users back. Trust, credibility, reputation, and legitimacy were factors that
participants clung to as positive outcomes of more transparency information:

13

14

NICHOLAS DIAKOPOULOS AND MICHAEL KOLISKA
I don’t know that it affects the public perception of the story in one way or another,
but I think that it might shape the internal process and improve the legitimacy and
the credibility of the projects in some way. (CS3)

Yet participants were also aware of transparency as a strategic act in which organizations might only disclose information that bolstered legitimacy but withhold information that somehow hurt the public’s image of the organization. Overall, transparency
was seen as something that can contribute to holding news organizations accountable,
but it does not seem to have a compelling business case.

Discussion and Conclusion
Our results indicate that there are numerous aspects of algorithmic systems that
could be disclosed in an effort to advance a journalistic truth-telling process that
increasingly hinges on the norm of transparency. While our findings indicate two key
dimensions as obstacles to algorithmic transparency: (1) a lack of business incentives
for disclosure, and (2) the concern of overwhelming end-users with too much information, we were able to identify several opportunities for disclosure across four main layers of the input–output pipeline of algorithms: data, model, inference, and interface.
Recent theoretical research on the ethics surrounding algorithmic journalism (Dörr and
Hollnbuchner 2016) suggests aspects of data and code transparency that the current
study empirically enumerates. Participants repeatedly emphasized the essential role
humans play in all of these four areas. Recent work by Ananny (2015) to develop an
ethical framework around algorithms cedes this point by considering the sociotechnical
aggregation of code, practices, and norms as the unit of ethical analysis. Others have
made inroads to studying the ethics of algorithmic systems through ethnographic techniques that allow for thick description of the dynamic human design processes around
algorithmic system development (Neyland 2016). To the degree that they can be, a
central challenge for the future study of algorithmic transparency will be to disentangle
the roles and decisions of humans versus algorithms in specific algorithmic systems in
order to highlight the hybrid nature of these systems.
The various criteria of disclosure suggested by this research proffer an opportunity
to advance the deontological ethics of algorithms (Ananny 2015; Sandvig et al. 2015) by
suggesting standards for what might be disclosed about algorithmic systems, including
aspects of human involvement. The typology of factors enumerated in Table 1 forms a
palette of options that may be disclosed about algorithms as part of an incipient algorithmic transparency standard. Such a standard can be informative not only for the disclosure of information about algorithms but perhaps also for the design of algorithms
tuned to facilitate such disclosures. At the same time we must be careful to state that
our framework may not be entirely comprehensive since it relies on the insights from
participants around three case studies. While we chose these cases to be distinct and to
cover diverse ways in which algorithms are used across the media production pipeline,
they may not span the entire space of algorithms in use in news systems. Still, our
results should spur future experimentation and evaluation of how such disclosures
might be adopted by news organizations and subsequently received by end-users as a
part of editorial guidelines or professional standards. This is a pragmatic path forward as
one survey of journalists found that the largest impacts on journalist behavior were

Downloaded by [University Of Maryland] at 07:40 27 July 2016

ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY IN THE NEWS MEDIA

company editorial guidelines (59 percent thought there was some or high impact), and
professional codes of ethics (50 percent) (Powell and Jempson 2014).
The value systems of new media platforms or apps do not necessarily share the
same institutional origins as traditional media. Foundational norms and ethics around
issues such as the public interest, diversity, or transparency may not be present (Napoli
2015). The liminal press described by Ananny and Crawford (2015) in their study of news
app designers suggests that the value systems they observed were more oriented toward
end-user information needs, experiences, and engagement. Our results indicated a similar
focus, with conversations underscoring the end-user value proposition for information
disclosure, and implications for harming the user experience by providing too much irrelevant information. Self-regulation in news media accountability and algorithmic governance is not well incentivized (Fengler and Russ-Mohl 2014; Saurwein et al. 2015), but a
focus on user experience may provide a motivating path to implement transparency.
Rather than evoke normative arguments, news organizations might align information disclosures to enhance the user experience (Diakopoulos, Cass, and Romero 2014).
This would have the added advantage of subverting cost disincentives because the overall product would benefit by having a more appealing and satisfying user experience.
Such an approach would consider the tasks that users typically engage with in a news
application, such as browsing for news, accessing recommendations, and sharing, and
orient system transparency toward those tasks. This would require explicit task modeling
to know what decisions and tasks a user is indeed engaged with in a specific context.
This approach may be fruitful for transparency disclosures that are integrated directly
into a user interface. A limitation of the current study is that we cannot say anything
definitive about the real audience demand for algorithmic transparency. Future work
should evaluate the algorithmic transparency factors reported in this paper (summarized
in Table 1) in order to assess demand by end-users as well as how each factor affects
the usability, learnability, user satisfaction, acceptance, and credibility of the system.
Yet, while such a focus on user experience might provide a business-oriented
argument that is appealing to news organizations, the approach does not address a
wider notion of media accountability. There are aspects of transparency information
that are irrelevant to an immediate individual user context, but which are nonetheless
of importance in media accountability for a broad public such as fair and uncensored
access to information, bias in attention patterns, and other aggregate metrics of, for
instance, error rates. In other words, some factors may have bearing on an individual
whereas others have import for a larger public. Different disclosure mechanisms, such
as periodic reports by ombudspeople may be more appropriate for factors like benchmarks, error analysis, or the methodology of data collection and processing, since they
may not be of interest to or even comprehensible for many users yet demanded by
those who value an expert account and explanation (Tilly 2006). Such reports hold
organizations and institutions accountable but are not necessarily concerned with the
user experience on a news-item level. A multi-layered “pyramid” model involving hints
of transparency at the tip, the user-interface level, would then open up to progressively
broader and denser descriptions of system transparency as the motivated end-user
worked their way down to the base of the pyramid. This would support different types
of end-users taking advantage of transparency information—not just a generic general
end-user audience but an informed and interested range of actors such as other journalists, critics, activists, or policy makers.

An effective policy for algorithmic transparency in the news media will no doubt
require additional research, development, and experimentation. Practical approaches
will combine different disclosure formats that depend on the factor being disclosed
and the likely audience for that information. In summary, this research makes clear that
algorithmic transparency requires the consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives
including organizational incentives and costs, end-user tasks and utility, and ethical normative practices.
