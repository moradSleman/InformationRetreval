Selection Bias and Confounding in Case-Crossover
Analyses of Environmental Time-Series Data
Thomas F. Bateson1 and Joel Schwartz2

The case-crossover study design is a popular analytic tool for
estimating the effects of triggers of acute outcomes by envi?

ronmental exposures. Although this approach controls for
time-invariant confounders by design, it may allow for selec?
tion bias and confounding by time-varying factors. We con?
ducted a simulation study of the sensitivity of the symmetric
bidirectional case-crossover design to time-varying patterns in
exposure and outcome. We identified the effects of selection

bias and confounding on symmetric bidirectional case-cross?
over results and offer strategies to eliminate or reduce these
biases. Selection bias results when exposure in the reference
periods is not identically representative of exposure in the

hazard periods, even when the distribution of exposure is
stationary. This bias can be estimated and removed. Selection
bias also occurs when the distribution of exposure is nonstationary, but the adjusted symmetric bidirectional case-cross?
over methodology substantially controls for this. Confounding
results from a common temporal pattern in the exposure and
the outcome time series, but can also be the result of patterns
in exposure and outcome that, although asymptotically uncorrelated, are correlated at finite series lengths. All three biases
are reduced by choosing shorter referent-spacing lengths. This
effect is illustrated using data on air pollution and daily deaths

in Chicago. (Epidemiology 2001;12:654-661)

cases in a time series with daily events using an SBI
design. One solution is to restrict the cases to those that

allow matching both the lag and the lead reference
periods. For a study design choosing referents 7 days
before and after each hazard day, the study base for a
1,096-day time series would be all person-time giving
rise to the cases that occurred on or between days 8 and
1,089, yet reference days are chosen between days 1 and
1,096. Reference periods are used that are not eligible to
be hazard periods, resulting in differential sampling of
exposure. Those first and last days only contribute in?
formation as referents whereas the central days serve as
both hazard days and reference days for other hazard
days. If the distribution of exposure is nonstationary,
there will clearly be selection bias. Surprisingly, this bias

stationary because there will likely be unbalanced high
or low values of the exposure on those days. Only when
all days in a time series serve equally as both hazard and
reference days (that is, the sampling ratio for hazard and
reference days is equal for each day) does this selection
bias disappear. This situation is the inverse of the issue of
overlapping strata of control groups described by Austin

We subtracted the spacing-specific estimates of the

using the naive approach. For comparison, we analyzed
the same time series using a robust generalized additive

Poisson model. We modeled weather using natural
splines with 4 degrees of freedom for each term. We

Alongside these strengths, we have identified a sen?

bias from both systematic and random patterns in the
exposure time series and proposed a method for removing it. Even a small bias could be substantial in compar?
ison with some effect size estimates. We found selection
bias, on the log scale, as large as ?0.0461, where Poisson
regression yields a PM10 effect estimate of 0.0559. More?

changes in series length.

these data. The differences in effect estimates across the
nine referent-spacing lengths may be the result of sepa?

rate biases that rise and fall according to how each
referent-spacing length interacts with each of these pat?
terns. If we assume the differences are due to random
variability and are measuring the same underlying effect,
then we could use all of the reference pairs in a single
analysis. This analysis produced nearly identical results
as the comparable Poisson result. The relative efficiency
of this case-crossover result, with 18 controls, compared
with the Poisson result is 87.5%.
