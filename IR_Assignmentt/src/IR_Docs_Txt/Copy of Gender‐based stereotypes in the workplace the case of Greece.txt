Abstract

Purpose – Organizations need to address stereotypical bias in order to ensure that they do not
underutilize any segment of the talent pool, and scarce managerial skills are effectively deployed. To
this aim, research on gender stereotypes would provide valuable information to corporate leaders.
Given the dearth of empirical research on this issue for the case of Greece, the current study was
designed to explore the relationship between attitudes toward women as managers and gender-based
stereotypes.
Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire.
Participants in the survey were 173 full-time employees working for firms across all the sectors of the
economy.
Findings – The main findings indicate that the primary source of shaping respondents’ attitudes is
their own gender. Other personal characteristics such as age, education, managerial experience, and
working under a female supervisor seem not to have a measurable effect on employees’ stereotypic
attitudes toward women in management. Furthermore, organizational characteristics such as the
firm’s nationality, ownership, sector, or department do not seem to provide any source of variance in
employees’ attitudes.
Research limitations/implications – Further research to extend the current investigation to
employers and managers would allow for a more articulated discussion of the main sources of
influence on stereotypical attitudes toward women in management.
Originality/value – Given the scarcity of empirical research on stereotyping and women’s career
prospects in Greece, this study contributes to debates in the wider academic community on the issue
of analysing empirically stereotypic attitudes toward women as managers.

Introduction
On a global scale, women represent a relatively untapped source of talent in the
workplace. Even though progress has been made over the last decades, barriers to
women’s advancement continue to persist. Magazine headlines and a growing number
of surveys highlight the glass ceiling, a concept that refers to women when they face a
subtle set of barriers to career advancement. While women’s achievements of higher
levels of education and accumulation of human capital allow them to obtain entry-level
positions, these are not sufficient to lead women to positions of power. Hence, the
advancement of women into management has not kept pace with the astonishing
increase of working women in corporations across industrialized economies (ILO, 2003).
Among the reasons for the glass ceiling phenomenon such as the lack of role
models, mentoring, networking options, and the complexities of the dual role as
working woman and housekeeper (Crampton and Mishra, 1999), literature has singled
out society’s stereotypes and prejudices against women in positions of power (Catalyst,
2002, 2005). According to the latter, women are viewed as lacking in the competencies
and drive that are considered vital to be effective managers. In a new study, Catalyst,
an influential US organization that promotes women’s progress at work, found that
gender bias is alive and well in corporate America. Catalyst surveyed nearly 300
business leaders from Fortune 500 and smaller businesses nationwide, including 100

chief executives (Catalyst, 2005). Nearly across the board, the respondents judged
women more negatively than equally skilled men, particularly in male-dominated
professions regardless of actual results verified by more than 40 different studies.
Women comprised fewer than 2 per cent of Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 chief
executives, although they held half of all management and professional positions.
By shining a spotlight on this often unspoken and insidious barrier to women’s
advancement, the Catalyst study demonstrates how senior executives often use genderbased stereotyping rather than facts to judge managers.
In another major survey, Catalyst and Conference Board Europe found that gender
bias thrive in corporate Europe as well (Catalyst, 2002). This study questioned nearly
700 men and women in 20 countries and found that stereotypes and preconceptions
of women’s roles and abilities are the top barriers for female managers’ promotion
in Europe across regions and countries.
In corporate Greece, companies have been recruiting an increasing number of
women in recent years, but in most cases have kept them in contingent job positions
and within the lower-managerial ranks (Ntermanakis, 2003; European Foundation,
2002). Young Greek women, in large numbers, have been enrolling in business
administration programs in order to attain all the necessary skills and knowledge to
advance in business as managers (Kottis, 1996; Kotsilieri and Marshall, 2004; Mavridis,
2002). Still, among the graduates of ten years ago, the percentage of women who have
obtained managerial positions in the upper echelons is much lower than that of their
male counterparts. On average only 11 per cent of the board members among the 280
largest Greek firms were women, whereas the corresponding portion in all subsidiaries
of multinationals was zero (Kottis, 1996; European Commission, 2005). In the same
vein, Mavridis (2002), taking into account the number of females that are family
members of company owners, estimates that the share of non-family female managers
accounts for only 10.4 per cent in the managing board of directors in Greek firms.
Greek women’s under-representation not only in high managerial posts but in
power positions, in general, has been documented by international organizations. The
International Labor Office has recently reported data on the position of women in the
labor markets of 60 countries. According to these data, the Greek women’s share as
legislators, senior officials, and managers was 26 per cent while their share in the total
employment was 38 per cent (ILO, 2003, Table 2C; European Commission, 2005).
Some years ago one could suggest that not enough time had passed from the point
at which relatively large numbers of well-educated women entered Greek business to
allow development of the experience and job skills necessary for attaining managerial
positions and advancing up the managerial ladder. Such an argument cannot be
maintained any longer.Men in Greece are now running major corporations while
women are not. More specifically, it has been estimated that males’ ability to infiltrate
in positions as corporate managers after their studies is overwhelmingly higher than
that of their female counterparts. In fact, the infiltration rate for male graduates is
87 per cent compared to 13 per cent for well-educated females (Mavridis, 2002).
A growing number of studies tend to attribute the finding that males are promoted
more frequently and rapidly than equally qualified females to the influence of genderbased stereotypes (Owen and Todor, 1993; Cordano et al., 2002; Tomkiewicz et al., 2004).
Regarding the Greek case, gender stereotyping of women as managers seems to persist
in Greek culture, and may explain, at least partially, the well-documented fact that
women are still under-represented in the Greek business community (European
Commission, 2005; Papalexandris and Bourantas, 1991; Kottis, 1996).

Although one could agree with the plausibility of this interpretation, prior
measurement of people’s attitudes toward women in management would strengthen
such arguments. (Terborg et al., 1977). However, there is a scarcity of current empirical
studies that use an independent measure of stereotypes for the Greek case. Indeed,
there are no contemporary studies that measure to what extent female and male
managers are perceived differently in today’s corporate Greece.
This paper tries to shed light on this issue focusing on gender-based stereotypes
and exploring their relative impact on the formation of attitudes toward women in
Greek management. The study is organized in five parts. Following the first that serves
as an introduction, the second presents the theoretical framework of the research and
stipulates the research hypotheses. The third discusses the research design providing
information on the method and data collection of the survey. The fourth presents the
main findings of the empirical research. In the last part, the most important
conclusions of the empirical investigation are summarized.
Theoretical framework and research hypotheses
The gender-role stereotyping perspective
A great deal of attention has focused on the limited progress that women attain in the
corporate world. Indeed, there is a growing body of literature that has spanned the last
three decades regarding the issue of sex discrimination against women in corporate
management. Differential treatment of women has been reported in recruitment, pay,
and career development prospects (Brown, 1979). The most popular explanation for
this differential treatment stems from the gender-role stereotyping perspective.
According to this perspective, women have been socialized to adopt attitudes and
behavior that are in conflict with the demands of a successful managerial career
(Schein, 1973, 1975; Terborg, 1977).
The job of manager is seen as ‘‘male’’ thus requiring an achievement-oriented
aggressiveness and an emotional toughness, which are typically masculine traits.
On the other hand, the stereotype continues, women just do not have the personality
traits commonly assumed to be characteristics of managers. In general, pursuing a
managerial career requires skills and competencies imparted to men as a social group.
Employees and managers holding this type of stereotypic view are likely to perceive
women as ineffective managers in job positions incongruent with females’ more
traditionally passive gender role. (Schein, 1973, 1975, 1978; Rosen and Jerdee, 1974;
Powell and Butterfield, 1979; Brenner et al., 1989; Schein et al., 1989; Schein and
Mueller, 1992; Schein et al., 1996; Heilman et al., 1995; Powell et al., 2002). Such
stereotyping is detrimental to women’s advancement in the workplace, since negative
stereotypes of women influence how their employees perceive them, how other
managers perceive their work, how they are selected for further training and
development, and finally, how rapidly they advance.
More specifically, within this gender-centered theoretical framework research
compares the perceived attitudes and values attributed to working women with the
same perceived characteristics of men and/or managers. Schein (1973) in her seminal
work developed a 92-item leadership characteristic questionnaire and found that the
attributes ascribed to managers yielded a significantly higher correlation with the
description of a typical man than with that of a typical woman. Thus, it was shown
that a good manager is described predominantly in masculine terms. In other words,
the situation is one of ‘‘think manager, think male’’ and this correlation has been

confirmed by later studies (Brenner et al., 1989; Powell and Butterfield, 1979; Heilman
et al., 1995; Willemsen, 2002).
Schein and Mueller (1992) extended research on cross-cultural comparisons among
US, British, and German management students. They found that males in all three
countries perceive that successful middle managers possess characteristics and
attitudes more commonly ascribed to men in general than to women in general. In a
similar vein, Schein and her colleagues (Schein et al., 1996) included Japan and China in
their research and concluded that ‘‘think manager-think male’’ is a global phenomenon.
In the gender-role stereotyping tradition, Terborg et al. (1977) criticized Schein’s
92-item scale by arguing that it was specifically constructed to focus on middlemanagement positions and the required personal traits that go along with these
positions, and not a measure of the full range of attitudes toward women as managers.
Peters et al. (1974), while acknowledging the influence of stereotypes on subsequent
discriminatory behavior toward women, developed the women as managers scale
(WAMS). They did so since they saw the need to create a suitable scale to measure
these stereotypes. This instrument has sparked a series of empirical studies for related
gender-role stereotyping research. Applying the WAMS scale, Terborg et al. (1977)
found that while organizational data do not relate consistently to attitudes toward
women as managers, the personal data of sex and education do consistently predict
attitudes toward women as managers.
This stream of gender-centered research led Garland and Price (1977), utilizing the
WAMS measure, to conclude that attitudes toward women managers are not related to
failure. WAMS scores were positively related to internal attributions (ability and effort)
and negatively related to external attributions (luck and easy job) when applied to
successful women managers. Similarly, Stevens and Denisi’s (1980) findings closely
matched the results reported by Peters et al. (1974) and partially those reported by
Garland and Price (1977). Bhatnagar and Swamy (1995) explored the relationship
between interaction with women managers in banking and attitudes toward women as
managers. Results showed little relation between the extent of interaction with women
managers and participants’ attitudes. However, there was a significant positive
relationship between satisfaction with interaction with women managers and
participants’ attitudes. These results were replicated when the authors used women
clerks instead of women managers in their survey.
Within the gender-role stereotyping framework, a series of empirical studies,
utilizing the WAMS scale, focused on the problems encountered by women outside the
USA in their efforts to pursue a career in traditionally male occupations such as
management. In this area of research, Papalexandris and Bourantas (1991) identified
differences in attitudes toward women as managers in Greece and tried to correlate
them with various personal and organizational characteristics of the participants.
They found that working women are more favourably disposed toward women
managers. Among personal characteristics, gender, age, and interaction with
women managers were found to be significantly correlated to attitudes toward women
as managers. Still, education and managerial experience were found to be insignificant
characteristics. Production departments and the manufacturing sector covaried
negatively with attitudes toward women as managers since these job positions, mostly
manual, are sex typed. Interestingly enough, they found that state sector covaried
positively to attitudes, a finding that is consistent with Rosen and Jerdee (1974)
argument that stereotypes appear to have less impact on decisions in workplaces
where specific rules and regulations are rigorously observed.

In another EU country, Malta, Cortis and Cassar (2005), in keeping with the gendercentered approach, found that both employees and students seem to hold more
stereotypical attitudes toward women in management than their female counterparts.
On the other hand, results indicate no differences between job-involvement and workbased self-esteem of male and female managers. Research in gender-role stereotyping
was extended to developing countries such as China and Nigeria. In the former case,
Liu et al. (2001) investigated attitudes, using the WAMS measure, toward women as
managers held by Chinese salespeople. Findings indicate that male salespeople
consistently rated the female sales managers lower than did female salespeople on
three sets of attitude items. Similarly, Adayemi-Bello and Tomkiewicz (1997) concluded
that gender-role stereotyping of managerial work in Nigeria result in the perception that
females are less qualified than males to hold managerial positions and this discourages
women from pursuing a career in management.
Tomkiewicz et al. (2004) have recently focused on cross-cultural analysis comparing
transitional economies to the American one. More specifically, their studies contrasted
the attitudinal environment toward women as managers among professionals in
Poland (as a proxy for transitional economies) with the environment of professionals
in the USA. They found, comparing WAMS scores for the two countries, that Polish
women who aspire to attain careers in management are likely to find intense attitudinal
impediments. Polish males appear even more conservative in their attitudes toward
women managers than do American males. In another cross-cultural study, Cordano
et al. (2002) developed a Spanish version of WAMS for examining attitudes toward
women managers in Chile and the USA. Across both attitudinal environments, two
measures were labelled ‘‘acceptance’’ and ‘‘ability’’. No cultural differences in the
acceptance of women as managers were detected. The differences in acceptance stem
from gender. Still, there were discernible differences in the perceived ability of women
managers for both gender and cultural variables. In this case, it was estimated that
gender explained approximately three times more variance in attitudes than culture,
a result that supports the gender-based stereotyping argumentation.
Research hypotheses
From the literature reviewed so far, gender-based stereotypes, particularly those
conditioning attitudes toward women as managers, seem to operate as ‘‘efficient’’ aids
or ‘‘signals’’ in decision-making concerning women’s access to managerial positions
and career advancement. Managerial outcomes often have few quantifiable measures
of success and thus stereotype-based bias is apt to creep into performance evaluations.
In such situations, stereotypes can ‘‘provide structure and meaning to otherwise
ambiguous data, and therefore are likely to weigh heavily in evaluations’’ (Heilman,
1997, p. 882).
Considering that women are under-represented in corporate Greece, along with
the fact that there is a lack of updated empirical research on this issue for the Greek
case and the relative impact of stereotypes on managerial careers, sufficient evidence
exists to legitimize the need for measuring and analysing gender-based attitudes
of people in the workplace. Drawing heavily on the gender-centered perspective
literature presented above, this study conducts an empirical investigation of the
relative importance of gender in forming perceptions of employees toward women as
managers.
Hence the objective of the present study is two-fold: first, the measurement of
working people’s attitudes toward women as managers and second, the identification

of the main factors that shape employees’ pertinent attitudes. To this aim, the current
study puts forward three hypotheses:
(1) significant attitudinal differences persist among the sexes of employees,

378

(2) compared to personal characteristics such as age, education, managerial
experience, and working under female supervision, gender emerges as the
primary source of stereotypic attitudes toward women as managers, and
(3) compared to organizational characteristics such as the company’s origin,
economic sector, industry, and department, gender still remains the dominant
factor for shaping stereotypic attitudes.
Methodology
Measure
The WAMS developed by Peters et al. (1974) is the measurement device used in this
study. This measure was created in the 1970s and its aim has been to facilitate the
exploration of personal and organizational data to sex-based stereotypes concerning
particularly women in management. The WAMS has been selected for the present
study since a search through the gender-role stereotyping literature for an instrument
capable of assessing attitudes toward women as managers proved relatively poor. The
only scale that has been used extensively in the relevant literature over the last decades
is that of Schein’s (1973). However, the author developed an index that was specifically
constructed to determine if the middle management position required personal traits
often thought to be more characteristic of men than of women. It did not measure,
though, the full range of attitudes toward women as managers.
By contrast, WAMS is a three-dimensional instrument, comprised of a set of 21
attitude statements that measures respondents’ perceptions of female managers in
general. The dimensions focus on respondents’ (a) acceptance of women as managers,
(b) negative stereotypes concerning women managers, and (c) personality traits or
managerial attributes generally believed to be descriptive of successful managers. As it
has been noted in the literature review above, the WAMS has been used in a broad
range of studies in the USA, in developing countries and in cross-cultural empirical
research (Papalexandris and Bourantas, 1991; Owen and Todor, 1993; Chow, 1995;
Ng, 1995; Adayemi-Bello and Tomkiewicz, 1997; Cordano et al., 2002; Tomkiewicz et al.,
2004; Cortis and Cassar, 2005). The scale has been employed with a broad range of
samples, including employees of an industrial distributing company (Terborg et al.,
1977) and library and information science master’s degree candidates (Murgai, 1991).
Even though the scale has been criticized as being transparent and easily falsified
(Rosen and Jerdee, 1975), supportive validity data have been reported (Terborg et al.,
1977; Garland and Price, 1977), and Ilgen and Moore (1983) verified its reliability and
dimensionality.
The questionnaire of the present study consisted of 11 items worded to favourably
describe women as managers and ten items worded unfavourably. Using a Likert-scale
format from 1(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), scale scores were obtained by
summing all 21 statements. The negatively worded items were reverse scored so that a
high scale score was associated with a favourable attitude toward women as managers.
Hence, the possible score ranges from 21 (highly unfavourable attitude) to 147 (highly
favourable). Besides the WAMS statements, the questionnaire was used for gathering
personal and organizational information on respondents. A Greek version of this

questionnaire was constructed to facilitate respondents filling in the questionnaire in
their native language.
Research design
The research design commonly used to test the gender-centered perspective includes
gender and other personal characteristics such as age and education as independent
variables and behavioral and attitudinal measures as the dependent variables. The
responses on the dependent variables (i.e. attitudes toward women as managers) are
typically elicited from the men and women who participate in a survey. In this study,
the WAMS mean score is the dependent variable. Independent variables are the
personal and organizational characteristics of the working people surveyed. Having
constructed all the variables, factor analysis and multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) allow assessing the relative impact of respondents’ characteristics on the
formation of attitudes toward women as managers.
Respondents
In order to survey working people’s attitudes toward women as managers, a sample of
firms was conveniently chosen from the northern part of Greece. This was necessary
since employers had to agree first to permit their employees to fill out a relatively
long questionnaire during working time on a controversial issue. The respondents
were employed across all the sectors of the economy: manufacturing and
construction (electrical power, oil products, food products, furniture, construction),
services (education, business consulting, internet services, restaurants and catering,
government agencies), banking and finance (commercial banks, central bank of
Greece), retail trade (appliances, medical tools, automobile parts, food products).
Questionnaires were distributed to 245 employees working at companies in northern
Greece. Employees within firm were given an introductory letter, explaining the aim of
the research, providing instructions of how to complete the questionnaire and ensuring
absolute confidentiality. Questionnaires were administered at work, they were filled out
anonymously and collected from respondents immediately upon completion. A total of
186 questionnaires were returned to the investigator of which 173 were completed
correctly in entirety. The high response rate is due to the fact that the surveyed firms
had agreed to participate in this research. The sample was comprised of 101 women
and 72 men. The respondents’ average age was 35.8 years (range: 22-65). More than
half of those sampled (54 per cent) held a college degree, and one fourth of the surveyed
people (24.8 per cent) occupied a managerial position supervising at least two
employees.
Results
The scale of employees’ attitudes toward women as managers was tested by using the
Cronbach’s alpha. This is a measure of internal consistency, based on the average interitem correlation. For the present study of 173 respondents, the scale had a reliability
coefficient of 0.86 which is considered satisfactory.
Mean scores were calculated for the WAMS items. The means were compared
to determine if any statistically significant differences existed between attitudes
toward women managers for female and male full-time employees. In fact, in order
to investigate the relationship of gender and other personal and organizational
characteristics to attitudes, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Results
of this analysis, shown in Table I, indicate that female employees expressed more

favourable attitudes toward women as managers than did male employees, a finding
that supports the validity of the first research hypothesis.
The differences in attitudes between the two samples were significant at the 0.001
level. The gender difference that existed in the scores was expected, since in studies
using the WAMS instrument, female respondents tended consistently to provide higher
scores than did males. (Owen and Todor, 1993; Tomkiewicz et al., 2004, Cortis and
Cassar, 2005).
Yet, age does not appear to be an important factor, since there was not a statistically
significant difference (p  0.01) on the WAMS total score between employees in their
20s and older counterparts.The younger generation’s perceptions toward women
managers practically appear not to deviate drastically from the older generation’s since
Greek society remains patriarchal and deeply rooted gender-based stereotypes persevere.
The mean scores of employees that have different educational background do not
differ significantly. It was estimated that employees holding a college degree tend to
have the same mean score with those that had completed high or elementary school.
More schooling seems not to have an effect on the shaping of attitudes toward women
as managers. This might be a profoundly disturbing finding considering that one
would expect that education would assist in reducing gender stereotyping, but this
appears not to be the case here. Yet with further investigation one is not surprised
if they examine the Greek educational system which heavily emphasizes technical
knowledge and remains outdated and detached from gender and other emerging social
issues of a modern society. Indeed, education in Greece continues to promulgate gender

stereotypes through its educational system that acts as an agent of socialization
further supporting the idea of male vs female roles and appropriate paths of careers for
each.
Another factor that has been included in the analysis of attitudes was the fact that
some employees worked under the supervision of a woman. The idea here is that an
employee being in a direct contact with a woman as a supervisor may serve to dispel
traditional gender stereotypes. Ezell et al. (1981) measuring the effects of having being
supervised by a woman on perceptions of female managerial competence found
significant differences only in the area of the motivation of a woman to manage. In the
present study, direct contact could not help in suppressing gender stereotypes. The
ANOVA indicated that the computed differences between employees that have been
supervised and their colleagues that have not been supervised by a woman were not
statistically significant. Simply, those employees having direct contact with a woman
manager did not express such strong attitudes toward women as managers that would
distinguish them from the other respondents.
Furthermore, direct contact with a female manager at the time of the questionnaire
improved only slightly the attitudes toward women as managers, thus not having a
practical impact on them. Indeed, taking into consideration those employees that were
supervised by a woman at the time of the questionnaire and contrasting their own
attitudes to those of employees that did not have such an experience, I found
differences in attitudes that they were not statistically significant at the 0.01 level.
Finally, I examined whether employees with managerial experience had more
favourable attitudes than those who did not have such an experience (Papalexandris
and Bourantas, 1991). Their differences in mean scores were so small that they were
statistically insignificant at the 0.01 level.
Hence, respondents’ personal characteristics, such as age, education, female
supervision, and managerial experience seem not to be associated to differences in
attitudes toward women as managers. By contrast, it has been estimated that attitudes
differ in a profound way when the employees’ characteristic is gender.
Apart from the personal characteristics, the study investigated whether mean
scores of attitudes toward women as managers vary significantly along with main
organizational characteristics. The ANOVA shown in Table I indicated that
respondents’ attitudes did not vary significantly with respect to ownership, economic
sector, and employees’ department in the employing organizations.
Regarding the latter, one might expect that the mean score is higher among whitecollar employees, since in production there is a lack of presence of women in line
management (Wellington et al., 2003) and men are considered more suitable to lead in
this activity (Papalexandris and Bourantas, 1991). People working in the service sector
might have less favourable attitudes. This could be attributed to the overrepresentation
of female employees in certain industries such as health care, catering, tourism, and
retail trade, occupying positions with low pay and gloomy career prospects (European
Commission, 2005). Respondents employed in state organizations might score higher
compared with those working for private companies, since building up a career in the
former sector relies heavily on formal credentials leaving little space for discrimination
based on gender stereotyping.
At first glance, in this study the computed scores of WAMS seem to indicate that
such organizational characteristics might be operative in forming attitudes toward
women as managers, but when ANOVA is applied the differences of means are found
not to be statistically significant. The only exception to this was the organizational

characteristic of the origin of the employing organizations. Respondents working in
Greek firms have more favourable attitudes toward women as managers than their
counterparts in foreign owned companies. In fact, according to the ANOVA, attitudes
differ statistically between the two groups of employees at the 0.01 level of significance.
One explanation is that Greek companies, especially the publicly quoted ones,
exhibit one of the highest participation rates of women in their executive bodies. The
Greek participation rate amounts to 20 per cent, that is double the average rate of the
European Union as a whole, and it is only the second highest in the Union, just below
the Spanish one (European Commission, 2005, p. 16). This can be easily explained
by the fact that well-known Greek firms have evolved from family owned companies.
In that case, female members of the owning families have a lot of chances to advance
themselves to the top of the managerial ladder and act as a role model for young welleducated female employees. This, in turn, might explain the formation of relatively
favourable attitudes among the employees of these organizations compared to those
held by people that work for foreign owned companies.
To further investigate the effect of gender on attitudes toward women as managers
I applied factor analysis for detecting possible underlying factors. Using MANOVA, I
examined the relative impact of employees’ personal characteristics along with main
organizational ones on the formation of attitudes across the detected underlying
factors.
A factor analysis was conducted to determine the dimensionality of WAMS. Table II
presents the factors obtained, the variables of each factor, and the factor loadings.
Factor analysis was performed with varimax rotation on the 21 variables from the
WAMS reports. Tests for appropriateness, including the Bartlett Test of Sphericity and
the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO ¼ 0.85) measure of sampling adequacy were performed
and all indicated the factor analysis was an appropriate technique. Three factors were
extracted, accounting for 44 per cent of the variance in attitudes toward women as
managers. All factors were internally consistent and well defined by the variables with
Cronbach’s a scores ranging from 0.64 (acceptable) to 0.86 (satisfactory).
Indeed, as shown in Table II, the statements of the WAMS are characterised in three
groups. Besides factor loadings for each single statement, the mean for each single
factor (as the average score of the means of its constituent items) are illustrated in
Table II. The first factor is labelled ‘‘ability’’ (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.86), since all the
statements refer to a woman’s ability to cope effectively with the challenges of
managerial roles. The second factor, is labelled ‘‘acceptance’’ (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.74), and
includes four statements that refer to the general acceptance of women as managers.
Finally, the third factor labelled ‘‘feminine barriers’’ (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.64) includes all
the barriers that could relate to femininity or to traits that usually are attributed to
women (pregnancy, child raising, and emotional sentiments). In all these three
dimensions of attitudes toward women as managers, female employees’ mean scores
indicate more favourable attitudes than those held by their male counterparts, a result
consistent with the first research hypothesis of this study.
By taking into account these factor analysis results, it seems interesting to examine
the differences between female and male respondents on all three WAMS factors
simultaneously, performing MANOVA. In fact, the effects of employees’ personal
characteristics as well as organizational ones are examined in terms of their influence
on respondents’ groups of attitudes concerning acceptance, femininity, and ability.
Information presented in Table III includes tests of each main effect on the three
groups of attitudes. The intercept refers to the remaining variance (usually the error

variance). As shown in Table III, F-tests indicate that only the employees’ gender
among the ten independent variables seems to be statistically significant. Equally
interesting are the results of the effect-size measure (partial eta squared). This indicates
how much of the total variance is explained by each main effect. In this case, the
respondents’ gender accounts for 22.2 per cent of the variance in the three WAMS
factors, an illustration of the relatively high importance of gender in explaining
attitudes’ variation. By contrast, each of the remaining nine independent variables
has a negligible impact on the three dimensions of attitudes toward women as
managers.
In addition to the multivariate tests, I performed simple univariate F-tests on each
of the three WAMS factors, namely ability, acceptance, and femininity. The results
shown in Table IV are similar to those of the multivariate tests shown in Table III.

The F-tests indicate that only the respondents’ gender among the ten independent
variables is found to be significant. Based on the effect-size measure, it was estimated
that the only source of variation for each single group of attitudes toward women
as managers is respondents’ gender. Employees’ gender seems to explain about
16 per cent of variation in ‘‘ability’’ attitudes, 8 per cent in ‘‘acceptance’’ attitudes, and
11 per cent in ‘‘femininity’’ attitudes, while any other characteristic – personal or
organizational – appears to have no measurable influence on any single dimension
of attitudes.
Concluding one could argue that the main findings of the study are consistent with
the gender-centered perspective. Indeed, as predicted by the second and third research
hypotheses, both the multivariate analysis and the univariate tests of the WAMS
indicate that the primary source of shaping full-time employees’ attitudes is their own
gender. Other personal characteristics such as age, education, managerial experience
and working under a female supervisor seem not to have a measurable effect on
respondents’ stereotypic attitudes toward women in management. Furthermore,
organizational characteristics such as firm’s nationality, ownership, sector, or
department do not seem to provide any source of variance in employees’ attitudes.
Conclusion
Implications of the study
Women who aspire to managerial careers in corporate Greece are likely to face intense
attitudinal barriers. This study employing the WAMS instrument attempted to
measure full-time employees’ attitudes toward women in management. As it was
hypothesized, male employees are found to hold relatively negative stereotypic
attitudes, compared to their female counterparts. More importantly, the central finding
of the study that gender was by far the most influential factor, among personal and
organizational traits, in accounting for the difference in attitudes is in agreement with
the gender-centered perspective. Thus this study, in keeping with previous empirical
studies for the Greek case (Papalexandris and Bourantas, 1991; Kottis, 1996), lends
support to Schein’s argument that ‘‘think manager-think male’’ is a global phenomenon.
Unfortunately, the present findings reveal a very troubling situation for careerdriven women in corporate Greece: gender stereotyping is still prevalent within Greek
culture and thus in the Greek workplace. The impact of gender in forming attitudes
toward women as managers was found to be dominant. Workplaces with gender-based
stereotypes so pervasive might render less effective targeted social policies, such as
maternity leave, and the right to equal pay. Employers that do not recognize genderbased prejudices in their workplaces will fail to take full advantage of well-educated
women’s talents and skills who aspire to attain a managerial career. However, it is
expected that in Greece, as in other societies grappling with the same dilemma, that
gradually economic exigency of intense market competition will force employing
organizations to tailor specific programs for promoting female managers’ career
prospects (Tomkiewicz et al., 2004).
Besides legislation, targeted policies in the workplace and ‘‘enlightened’’ employers,
policy makers, and employers’ representative bodies need to face the challenge of
gender-based stereotyping head on pursuing a systematic intervention in central
institutions that shape culture and ethos at a societal level, namely the educational
system and mass media. It is a matter of political will and wisdom for the government
to redesign curricula at the elementary and high school level aimed at eradicating job
segregation and stereotyping based on sex. Equally important, public and private

owners and experts of the mass media organizations need to address the issue of
gender-based stereotypes and redesign popular and especially entertainment programs
where new role models for the whole society are constantly shaped (Cortis and
Cassar, 2005).
Limitations of the study
The finding of this study is not without limitations. In this exploratory investigation,
the size and the geographical coverage of the sample on which the results were based
are relatively small, so conclusions must be drawn with precaution. Further extensive
research surveying more employees across the whole country would lead to more
reliable findings. Furthermore, the findings of this paper may not be easily applied to
other samples besides full-time employees. Hence, research to extend the current
investigation to other groups of respondents besides full-time employees seems
necessary. Examining and comparing attitudes among managers, full-time employees,
and business students would certainly allow for a more articulated discussion of the
main sources of influence on sex-role stereotyping in corporate Greece.
Future research along the lines suggested above can enhance our understanding of
gender-based stereotypes toward women in corporate Greece. Such knowledge is vital
since it is economically imperative for the country to allow an ever increasing number
of well-educated women to pursue their career advancement in the business world.
Research shedding light on the dominant role of gender-based stereotyping tends
to highlight the inherent contradiction between deeply rooted stereotypes of a
patriarchal society and its need to fully utilize the skills and talents of all its
citizens. This, in turn, hopefully might stimulate an overdue public discussion about
the economic irrationality and limitations of gender-based stereotypes among the
country’s political parties and more importantly among its corporate leaders.
