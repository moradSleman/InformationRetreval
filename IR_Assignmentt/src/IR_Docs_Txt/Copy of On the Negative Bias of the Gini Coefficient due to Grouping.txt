Abstract: The Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion that is commonly
used as a measure of inequality of income, wealth or opportunity. Empirical research
has shown that the coefficient may have a nonnegligible downward bias when data
are grouped. It is unknown under which grouping conditions the downward bias
occurs. In this note it is shown that the Gini coefficient strictly decreases if the data
are partitioned into equal sized groups.

Introduction

The Gini coefficient (Gini, 1912) is a measure of statistical dispersion
that is commonly used in various scientific disciplines, including economics,
sociology, health science and engineering. It is commonly used to quantify
inequality of wealth, income and opportunity, and inequality in education
between countries (Sen, 1977). The coefficient can be defined in various different ways (Jasso, 1979; Yitzhaki, 1998; Ceriani and Verme, 2012). Here,
we define the coefficient as the relative mean difference of the values of a
frequency distribution (Damgaard and Weiner, 2000). The Gini coefficient
of the real numbers x1 , x2 , . . . , xn is

Formula (1) is equal to the mean of the difference between every possible
pair of values, divided by the mean value size.
The Gini coefficient measures the dispersion among the values of the
frequency distribution. If all values are positive the coefficient produces values between 0 and 1. The coefficient has value 0 if all the values are equal.
In this case there is perfect equality. Values near 1 express high inequality
among the values. Furthermore, the coefficient is invariant under multiplication of a positive constant. Moreover, different frequency distributions may
have the same value of the Gini coefficient.
In many applications the Gini coefficient is estimated from grouped
data with 5 to 30 categories instead of the microdata (Gastwirth, 1972;
Abounoori and McCloughan, 2003). For example, income or tax statistics
are often grouped for confidentiality reasons (Van Ourti and Clarke, 2011).
Empirical research has shown that the Gini coefficient may have a nonnegligible downward bias when data are grouped (Lerman and Yitzhaki, 1989;
Davies and Shorrocks, 1989; Kwok, 2010). Vice versa, Kwok (2010) noted
that the Gini coefficient increases if a combined household is split into several smaller households or people living alone. Thus, the Gini coefficient
may produce different results for income when the units of analysis are individuals instead of households (Deininger and Squire, 1996). Therefore, in
interpreting the Gini coefficient the demographic structure of a country or
region should be taken into account.
The Gini coefficient may decrease if the data are grouped, but it may
also increase. For example, for x = {1, 1, 2, 2} we have G = .167. Indeed,
adding the first and second value of x we obtain x = {2, 2, 2} and G = 0.
However, if we add the second and third value of x we obtain x = {1, 3, 2}
and G = .222, whereas if we add the third and fourth value of x we get
x = {1, 1, 4} and G = .333. The latter two cases show that the Ginivalue may also increase if the data are grouped. Specific grouping conditions
under which the downward bias of the Gini coefficient occurs have not been
formulated. New insights into the properties of the coefficient with respect
to data grouping are therefore welcomed.
In this research note, it is proved that the Gini coefficient strictly decreases if the values of a frequency distribution are partitioned into equal
sized groups and the combined values are analyzed. An immediate consequence is that, vice versa, the Gini coefficient increases if the units are split
into equally sized parts. A theorem that formalizes these statements is presented in the next section. An example and discussion are presented in the
last section.

A Theorem

In this section, we show (Theorem 1) that the Gini coefficient strictly
decreases if the data are partitioned into equal sized groups.
Theorem 1. Suppose d divides n with 1 < d < n. The Gini coefficient of
x1 , . . . , xn decreases if the values are partitioned into groups of size d and
the combined values are analyzed.
Proof. Let m = n/d. Let xik denote value i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , d} in group
k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. Furthermore, define for each group k the sum
sk =

In the absolute difference |xik − xi |, the value xik of group k is compared
to the value xi from group . The value xik can also be compared to one of
the d − 1 other values xj in group . Thus, we have d variants of inequality
(5) such that in each variant a value of group k is compared to a different
value in group . If we sum these d variants of (5) we obtain

case, equality (8) implies the inequality

An Example and Discussion

Table 1 presents the income in Australian dollars from 2013 of twentyfour individuals. The numbers were made freely available by the Australian
Government (http://data.gov.au). The particular numbers in Table 1 are
the twenty-four top numbers on income of the 2012-13 Individual sample
file. Six people did not have an income in 2013. The maximum income is
192669, the average income is 45066, and the total income for the twentyfour individuals is 1081585. For Table 1 we have G = .540.

Table 2 presents the Gini-values that are obtained by grouping the
data in Table 1. The first line corresponds to the case of no grouping (or
twenty-four groups). The second line with twelve groups corresponds to
the case in which the first two incomes are grouped (67848 + 50335), the
second two values are grouped (14537 + 37495), and so on. The third line
with eight groups corresponds to the case where the first three values are
grouped (67848 + 50335 + 14537), and so on. The bottom line with two
groups corresponds to the case where the first and last twelve incomes are
grouped.
Table 2 shows that, for the data in Table 1, the Gini coefficient tends to
decrease when the number of groups becomes smaller. Theorem 1 applies
to two partitions that are nested. For two numbers from the first column
of Table 2, if the bottom number is a divisor of the top number, then the
two partitions are nested, and the partition associated with the top number
is finer than the partition associated with the bottom number. Consider, for
example, the sequence starting with 24 to 12 to 6 to 3 groups. In each
step the values are partitioned into groups of equal size. Furthermore, the
associated G-values strictly decrease (from .540 to .303 to .226 to .193).
Another illustration of Theorem 1 is the sequence from 24 to 8 to 4 to 2
groups. Again, the associated G-values strictly decrease (from .540 to .253
to .161 to .138).
Theorem 1 is also applicable to income and wealth distribution tables
(see, e.g. Kerbo, 2000). These tables typically summarize the income and

wealth frequency distributions using a number of quantiles. Quantiles divide
a frequency distribution into equal groups, each containing the same fraction
of the total population. If two sets of quantiles are nested, Theorem 1 tells
us that the set with higher granularity (higher number of quantiles) will have
a higher Gini coefficient. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity)
will yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles taken from the
same distribution. Hence, it is important in applications that the Gini-value
is reported together with the proportions of the quantiles used for measurement.
Finally, a limitation of Theorem 1 is that the units of analysis must
be partitioned into equal sized groups. As demonstrated in the introduction,
if the units are partitioned into groups of different sizes, it depends on the
data at hand whether the Gini coefficient increases or decreases. On the
other hand, the theorem puts no restrictions on which values are combined.
Furthermore, some of the values are allowed to be negative or zero.
