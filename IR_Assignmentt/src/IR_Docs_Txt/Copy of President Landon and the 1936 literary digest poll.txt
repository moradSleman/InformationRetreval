“President” Landon and the
1936 Literary Digest Poll
Were Automobile and Telephone Owners to Blame?

The disastrous prediction of an Alf Landon victory in the 1936 presidential election
by the Literary Digest poll is a landmark event in the history of American survey
research in general and polling in particular. It marks both the demise of the straw poll,
of which the Digest was the most conspicuous and well-­regarded example, and the rise
to prominence of the self-­proclaimed “scientific” poll. Why did the Digest poll fail so
miserably? One view has come to prevail over the years: because the Digest selected its
sample primarily from telephone books and car registration lists and since these contained, at the time, mostly well-­to-­do folks who would vote Republican, it is no wonder
the magazine mistakenly predicted a Republican win. This “conventional explanation”
has found its way into countless publications (scholarly and in the press) and college
courses. It has been used to illustrate the disastrous effects of a poorly designed poll.
But is it correct? Empirical evidence, in the form of a 1937 Gallup poll, shows that this
“conventional explanation” is wrong, because voters with telephones and cars backed
Franklin D. Roosevelt and because it was those who failed to participate in the poll
(overwhelmingly supporters of Roosevelt) who were mainly responsible for the faulty
prediction.

Polling and survey research more generally are data collection technologies
widely used today in the social sciences. Many apprentices of these disciplines will take a college course in research methods and be told what constitutes a good survey and how to recognize a bad one. Most likely, as an illusSocial Science History 36:1 (Spring 2012)

tration of the latter category, the instructor will recount the story of the 1936
Literary Digest presidential poll: it predicted the wrong winner (Alf Landon, the Republican challenger), and, to top it all off, its forecast error was
huge (nearly 20 points). They will also be told most probably that the reason
for this fiasco was the magazine’s reliance on telephone directories and car
registration lists to select its sample,1 thereby biasing it, in the midst of the
Depression, in favor of the better-­off portion of the electorate, which was
bound to vote for the Republican nominee.
Budding social scientists are not the only ones who will have heard this
story. Just like baseball, polling is now entrenched in the American culture;
the general public is inundated with polls, especially during an election year.
From time to time, this tale will appear in the press (e.g., Higgins 2010) and
in other publications accessible to the lay public (e.g., Zunz 1998: 64).
But is this account correct? And how did it come about? The answer
to the first question will be the primary focus of this article. As for the second question, the explanation for what went wrong with the Digest poll was
largely crafted by the new players in this arena: the so-­called scientific poll
takers (Archibald M. Crossley, George H. Gallup, and Elmo Roper). Indeed,
the 1936 presidential election witnessed not only the demise of traditional
straw polls, chiefly as a result of the Digest poll’s massive blunder, but the
emergence of “scientific” polling. The advent and development of these new
polls was made possible by their use of novel sampling methods and by their
relative success in predicting the outcome of the election but more specifically by outperforming the Digest poll.
Gallup, founder in 1935 of the American Institute of Public Opinion
(AIPO), and his fellow pollsters (Crossley and Roper) had a major stake in
this story. After their “triumph” over the Digest (Rusciano 2007: 315), they
were particularly keen to explain the superiority of their approach and show
why the old “methods” used by straw polls, of which the Digest was the most
prestigious example, were fundamentally unsound. Crossley (1937: 27) put
it most bluntly: “The Literary Digest method is outmoded.” In contrast, the
new “scientific” polling was capable, they believed, of rendering a true image
of America. According to Roper (1940: 326), “Our purpose is to set up an
America in microcosm.” The superior value of this methodology, as Gallup
(1972a: 146) saw it, rested on what he called “scientific sampling procedures”2 that could yield a representative sample of the population of interest:3
specifically, it could produce a miniature version of the electorate.4 To pro-

1936 Literary Digest Poll

mote the new venture, Gallup had to demonstrate that straw polls in general,
and the Digest in particular, were based on samples that were biased, that is,
unrepresentative of the American electorate.5 All through his career Gallup
reiterated his version of the failure of the 1936 Digest poll. His authority in
the field of polling and survey research was so great that his interpretation
has been repeated countless times to college students and others and has pervaded textbooks and manuals on survey research methods and other scholarly works as well as newspaper and magazine stories. Even in the face of
empirical evidence contradicting it (Squire 1988), this view persists.
Building on previous investigations (Bryson 1976; Cahalan 1989; Cahalan and Meier 1939; Squire 1988), the focus of this article is to show that
the available empirical evidence regarding the causes of this event does not
support what has been called the “conventional explanation” (Erikson and
Tedin 1981: 953). It will become clear that the Digest’s original list was no
impediment to predict the correct winner. The reason for the magazine’s
mistaken prognosis was that those who participated in the poll (the respondents) turned out heavily in favor of the Republican challenger, whereas most
of the incumbent president’s supporters failed to return their straw ballots—
this is referred to as nonresponse bias.6
This article proceeds as follows. First, I describe how the conventional
explanation emerged in the aftermath of the poll’s blunder and how pervasive
this explanation is in the scholarly literature and in other publications that
refer to this event. Then, I examine previous attempts to use the only available empirical evidence about the Digest poll’s failure, and I reanalyze this
evidence with techniques advocated by Adam J. Berinsky (2006) when survey
results originate from quota-­controlled polls of the 1930s. I also look at the
response rate of various sociodemographic groups. Next, I discuss the shortcomings of the Gallup poll of 1937 and see if they negate the conclusions of
this reanalysis. Finally, I offer some general remarks about the Digest poll and
propose lessons that can be drawn from it by social science researchers.

The Genesis of the Conventional
Explanation and Its Diffusion
A few days before the 1936 presidential election, in which the incumbent
Roosevelt was being challenged by Landon, the Literary Digest, a weekly
magazine with a surprisingly good track record in predicting the outcomes

26

Social Science History

of previous electoral contests,7 published the results of its presidential poll:
it predicted that Landon would defeat Roosevelt—the former would receive
54 percent of the total popular vote, while the incumbent president would
get only 41 percent. In fact, Roosevelt obtained 61 percent of the vote (US
Bureau of the Census 1970: 354). Although this severe blunder destroyed
the credibility of the magazine, which went out of business two years later,
it became a major milestone in the history of polling and survey research in
the United States.
What happened? The magazine mailed out in the neighborhood of 10
million “ballots” (postcards) based on a number of sources: the rosters of
clubs and associations, voter registration rolls, occupational records, classified mail-­order and city directories (Literary Digest 1936a: 3–4). But the
bulk of its list was based on telephone directories and registers of automobile
owners.8 Of the 10 million cards sent out, nearly 2.4 million were returned,
for a response rate of roughly 24 percent. How is it possible that with a
sample of that size the magazine blundered so badly?
Much has been written about this event over the years, and many are
those who have referred to it. For the purpose of this study, these commentators can be grouped into three categories. First, there are the protagonists:
those who lived through the event and had a direct stake in explaining what
had gone wrong. These include the “scientific” pollsters (Crossley, Gallup,
and Roper) who promoted the explanation that was to define the event for
years to come. A second group, the outsiders, is formed by those who are contemporaries of the protagonists but are located at the periphery of the polling
world: they are more disinterested observers. The last group is referred to as
the heirs, because, for the most part, they simply repeat the explanation of the
event advanced by the protagonists and their fellow travelers.
The first to seek an explanation for what had happened to the poll was,
not surprisingly, the Literary Digest itself. In the November 14, 1936, issue
of the magazine, the editors pondered over what had happened: why, having
used the “same method” that had been so successful in the past, could they
have been so far off the mark?9 They dismissed emphatically the charge
that the Digest, because it relied on “telephone books and lists of automobile owners,” “simply did not reach the lower strata.” Their mailing list was
much more comprehensive, and they insisted that the ballots they sent out
“did reach these so-­called ‘have-­nots’ strata.”10 They cited three cities (Chicago; Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Allentown, Pennsylvania) in which they

1936 Literary Digest Poll

27

polled from one-­third to all registered voters and obtained the same results
as they did at the national level.
The editors had a lot of questions about their poll’s failure but could
not come up with an explanation. However, some of the questions they asked
contained the germ of an answer. For example, they wondered: “Why did
only one in five voters in Chicago to whom The Digest sent ballots take the
trouble to reply? And why was there a preponderance of Republicans in the
one-­fifth that did reply?” These two questions could have been applied just
as easily to the results at the national level, but the editors did not make the
connection. Indeed, fewer than a quarter of the ballots mailed out had been
returned, and a predominance of them came from Republicans—perhaps
this was an indication that the 24 percent who responded to the poll were
very different in candidate preference from the rest of the original sample.
This hypothesis did not occur to the editors—after all, they were not polling
experts in the current sense of the term; besides, polling and survey research
was a nascent field. They viewed their poll as a “public service” that gave
voice to those who cared to participate. As they declared candidly: “We did
not attempt to interpret the figures.” They were content with their “scrupulous bookkeeping.” They clung to the belief that “in that great mass of post-­
card votes, representing the opinions of every section, class, age and occupation will be found the answer” (Literary Digest 1936b: 5).
If the Digest editors could not provide answers, the “scientific” pollsters (Crossley, Gallup, and Roper) and their fellow travelers were ready and
willing to do so. Claude E. Robinson (1937: 52–53), who in 1938 became the
associate director of AIPO and had studied straw polls extensively (see also
Robinson 1932), wrote shortly after the Digest fiasco:
The principal flaw in the [Digest] poll was that the sample was drawn primarily from higher income groups. In collecting its ballots the Digest has
always used telephone and automobile names for its mailing list. In a few
of the larger cities ballots have been sent to registered voters, but by far
the largest percentage of the mailings has gone to owners of telephones
and automobiles. (emphasis added)
Fellow travelers in academe, such as Hadley Cantril, would provide further
legitimacy to this story. In 1937 he and his colleague Daniel Katz stated:
“The Digest sent its ballots to names taken largely from readily accessible
sources such as telephone books and automobile registration lists. . . . From

28

Social Science History

the very start, therefore, the poll was loaded toward the upper income level”
(Katz and Cantril 1937: 158).
The story was also echoed at the periphery by nonprotagonists but scholarly observers, the outsiders. “The cause of the Literary Digest’s humiliating
defeat was evident,” the statistician Frederick F. Stephan (1939: 343) stated
emphatically. “Its postcard questionnaires reached and were returned by the
predominantly Republican upper and middle income classes in greater proportions than they reached and were returned by the predominantly lower
income classes.”11 Fellow statistician Samuel S. Wilks (1940: 266), future
president of the American Statistical Association, concurred: “The names
of people to be polled were selected from such lists as telephone directories,
automobile registration lists, etc. It is quite obvious that such a system of
selection will be biased by having too large a proportion of the higher income
and social groups, which in the 1936 presidential election were known to be
heavily weighted in favor of Landon.” “It is well known,” Wilks added, “that
individuals in the lower income levels are not as responsive to mail ballots as
those higher up the scale, which would only accentuate the first kind of bias.”
Of the three polling pioneers, Gallup wrote the most and the longest about this event. Throughout his career he mentioned the Digest poll
in books, articles, and interviews.12 “With the exception of a few cities,” he
wrote, “the Digest sampled only owners of automobiles and telephones. It
neglected for the most part the very poor and those with little purchasing
power. . . . The income bias in the Digest sample resulted in a disproportionate number of Landon votes” (Gallup 1938: 139). Although other factors in
the poll’s demise were cited (Gallup and Rae 1940: 48–49), they were considered only minor issues. In fact, as time went by any details regarding the
account of the Digest’s failure were swept aside (Blondiaux 1998: 259). In
the end, what was left of the explanation was reduced to this: “The failure
of the Literary Digest’s polling approach can be explained rather simply. The
Digest’s sample of voters was drawn from lists of automobile and telephone
owners” (Gallup 1972a: 147).
Given the consensus that quickly emerged on this issue, what reason
would one have to doubt what Gallup and other protagonists had to say about
the failure of the 1936 Digest poll? His position as “the dean of public opinion experts” (Bryson 1976: 184) gave him an aura of infallibility. So it is not
surprising that, when a reference was made to the Digest poll’s debacle, this
explanation permeated the social science discourse very quickly.

1936 Literary Digest Poll

29

As early as 1952, one could read in a prominent scholarly journal: “The
chief weakness of that [the Digest] poll was that it did not reach a representative cross section of the electorate. Particularly in the depression years,
many people in the lower income groups did not have telephones, and were
therefore not listed in the telephone directories. For this reason the ballots
were not mailed to a representative cross section” (Smith 1952: 150; emphasis added). This assessment could be found some years later, for example,
in the very authoritative Handbook of Survey Research: “The Literary Digest
straw polls of telephone subscribers were based on returns of millions of ballots mailed to all telephone subscribers in the United States” (Rossi et al.
1983: 3). It spread as well to the field of electoral studies and voting behavior.
Thus one author states that the Digest sample was made up of the “attentive middle class” drawn “from telephone books and automobile registration
lists” (Shively 1972: 621). Also, one authority on US elections past and contemporary writes, more elusively, “It is now commonly understood that the
success of the prescientific Literary Digest poll from 1908 through 1932 rested
on the absence of any autonomous class cleavage in electoral politics, just as
the poll’s disastrous failure in 1936 reflected the emergence of this fatally
decisive variable” (Burnham 1987: 119). Implicit in this argument is that the
Digest sample was biased toward the more affluent, but because “social class”
was not a variable that had an effect on voting preference before 1936, one
could rely on any one class to predict presidential elections. It will be shown
later that there is evidence to contradict this assertion.
The author of a little book on the misuse of statistics that has enjoyed
a great deal of popularity writes: “People who could afford telephones and
magazine subscriptions in 1936 were not a cross section of voters. Economically they were a special kind of people, a sample biased because it was
loaded with what turned out to be Republican voters” (Huff 1954: 20). Other
examples can be found. For instance, a well-­respected textbook on survey
research methods states: “The Digest sample was drawn from telephone
directories and automobile registration lists, a sampling procedure that . . .
did not provide a representative cross section of American voters” (Babbie
1990: 67). One can also refer to a current statistics manual and read: “[The]
Literary Digest magazine tried to predict the outcome [of the presidential
election] by mailing 10 million questionnaires to people selected from three
sources: the subscription list for the magazine, telephone directories, and
automobile registration records” (Bernstein and Bernstein 1999: 63). The

30

Social Science History

same picture, although more nuanced, is presented in another text on sample
surveys; explicitly using Gallup as a reference, the author writes: “One of
the reasons that [the Digest poll] pointed to the wrong candidate was that
the voters selected in the sample were, for the most part, telephone subscribers and owners of automobiles” (Raj 1972: 331).13 This view of the cause
of the Digest poll’s blunder has also propagated itself beyond our borders
(Desrosières 1998: 233; Gidengil 1992: 244; Moon 1999: 10–12; Ozouf 1963:
4; Robinson 1999: 40; Weiner 1976–77: 675).
This review is by no means exhaustive (see also, among many others,
Bradburn and Sudman 1988: 19; Burner and Rosenfield 2003: 409; Erikson
1976: 26; Erikson and Tedin 1981: 953;14 Field 1983: 198–99; Herbst 1993: 70;
Igo 2006: 111; Kitchens 1987: 8; Ladd 1985: 332; Oberschall 2008: 87; Weisberg et al. 1998: 42). But it is highly suggestive: it clearly shows that the conventional explanation is firmly entrenched in the scholarly community and,
by extension, in the interested public at large (e.g., the press), and it persists
even after evidence has surfaced that contradicts it (Squire 1988). In her history of survey research in the United States, Jean M. Converse (1987: 120)
states: “Gallup’s theory of the Digest’s failure has not been improved upon
in any major way.” Later it will become evident, through a poll conducted by
Gallup’s own organization, that his “theory” is not supported by the data.15

Doubting the Conventional Explanation:
A Skeptic and Empirical Data
The conventional explanation was never seriously challenged until 1976. This
happened in a short article titled “The Literary Digest Poll: Making of a Statistical Myth” published in the American Statistician. The author, Maurice
Bryson (1976: 184) found it “inherently implausible.” In his view, it could not
explain the huge error made by the Digest; that error and the low response
rate, Bryson (ibid.: 185) argued, pointed to “voluntary response,” and thereby
nonresponse bias, as the more likely candidate for the poll’s blunder. But he
presented no evidence for his argument.
Surely, if there were data that indicated how telephone and car owners
voted in the 1936 election, we could move away from the realm of conjecture (Gallup’s and Bryson’s). If we found that telephone and car owners
voted massively for Landon, the conventional explanation would be vindicated; if, on the other hand, we found the opposite, then it could be dis-

1936 Literary Digest Poll

31

carded and another explanation for the poll’s blunder could be sought (perhaps Bryson’s).
Actually, this evidence did exist. It had been gathered by a Gallup poll in
May 1937. How did that come about? By this time, the AIPO was conducting
polls on a monthly basis, and more than five dozen newspapers nationwide
were subscribing to its service and publishing the results (News-­Week 1936:
14). Don Cahalan, a student at the University of Iowa, was working toward a
master’s degree in psychology. The focus of his research was to identify the
factors affecting the validity of mail-­ballot polls (Cahalan 1989: 132). Cahalan
asked the AIPO to include questions about the 1936 Digest poll in one of its
surveys. His thesis director, Norman C. Meier, had been one of Gallup’s professors at Iowa (Ohmer 2006: 82). The questions were added to a Gallup poll
that dealt with current issues and was fielded between May 19 and May 24,
1937. Aside from asking whom respondents had voted for in November 1936,
the questionnaire included three questions about the Digest poll:
•
•
•

Did you receive a Literary Digest straw vote ballot in the Presidential
campaign last fall?
Did you send it in?
Did you change your mind regarding the candidate between the time
you sent it in and the election?
(Roper Center for Public Opinion Research 2003a: 3)

The AIPO survey also collected demographic information, such as occupation, age, social/income status (“poor,” “average income,” etc.), ownership of
a telephone and automobile, gender, and “race” (white or “colored”).
Cahalan had also conducted his own survey in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a
“representative community” (Cahalan and Meier 1939: 4), between December 1936 and February 1937 that was based on telephone interviews of a systematic random sample of n = 693. The survey achieved a response rate of
80 percent.16 Cahalan and Meier had used a sampling frame of more than
10,000 names from the list the Digest had put together from the telephone
book (Cahalan 1989: 130).
The results of both surveys were analyzed by Cahalan and Meier in the
February 1939 issue of the Psychological Record. The authors noted that the
reported response rate to the Digest poll from participants in both the Cedar
Rapids survey (59 percent) and the AIPO poll (61 percent) was much higher
than the actual one of 24 percent (Cahalan and Meier 1939: 5–6). They

32

Social Science History

reported also that both surveys indicated that the Digest poll was biased on
a number of variables: age, sex,17 and party preference. Regarding the latter,
they failed to state that the difference, in Cedar Rapids, between Roosevelt
(47 percent) and Landon (53 percent) was not statistically significant and
was consistent with the election results in that city: each candidate received
an equal share of the vote (Cahalan 1989: 131). Thus on this evidence, it was
incorrect of Cahalan and Meier (1939: 8) to conclude that the original Digest
list for Cedar Rapids suffered from “over-­Republicanism.” They observed
the same flaw in the Digest (national) sample, as described by the AIPO poll,
but they neglected to point out that it favored Roosevelt (56 percent) over
Landon (44 percent).18 However, they did emphasize that this error was
“minor” compared with “factors related to ballot return” (ibid.). Indeed,
their results show that in the AIPO survey nearly 75 percent of Landon supporters in the Digest poll reported returning their straw ballots, compared
with only 57 percent of Roosevelt backers. The same happened in the Cedar
Rapids survey: Landon’s followers were twice as likely to return their straw
ballots as Roosevelt’s (ibid.: 6).
These results plainly contradicted the conventional explanation that
was advertised by the protagonists at the time (e.g., Robinson 1939: 3) and
has persisted until this day. According to these data, what sank the Digest
poll was nonresponse bias. But the most glaring omission in this 1939 article
was the fact that the authors never discussed how telephone and automobile
owners voted, even though this information was available from the AIPO
survey. This is an amazing oversight, since the reliance on telephone directories and car registration lists was the defining characteristic of the Digest poll.
Moreover, Cahalan and Meier say nothing of the fact that the poll in Cedar
Rapids relied entirely on telephone subscribers, a source that does not seem
to have introduced a political party bias.
Clearly, Cahalan and Meier’s article had little impact on the scholarly
community and beyond.19 It was not even cited by Peverill Squire in his 1988
article in the Public Opinion Quarterly, the flagship journal of survey research
practitioners. The irony is that, at the time of his study of the 1936 poll’s failure, Squire was an assistant professor of political science at the same university where Cahalan had done his research. Squire used the same 1937
AIPO poll that Cahalan had been instrumental in designing but appears to
have been unaware that it had already been reported on.20 Cahalan (1989)
remarked on the irony a year later in the Public Opinion Quarterly.21

1936 Literary Digest Poll

33

Like the previous authors, Squire (1988: 129) noted that the poll had an
overrepresentation of people who claimed to have returned their Digest ballots, but he also pointed out that it overestimated the percentage received by
the winning candidate. His conclusions, however, were similar to what was
apparent from Cahalan and Meier’s article. Squire (ibid.: 130) stated that
“if everyone who had received a [Digest] ballot had returned it the results
would have, at least, correctly predicted Roosevelt a winner.” It was clear
to him that “nonresponse bias contributed greatly to the failure of the Literary Digest to correctly call the winner” (ibid.: 131). Yet his overall conclusion was somewhat muddled. Thus, after acknowledging the importance of
nonresponse bias, he stated: “But, more importantly, the initial sample was
flawed” (ibid.). Why “more importantly,” when he had just demonstrated
that the Digest would have called the correct winner if everyone had returned
his or her straw ballot? Perhaps it is because he attempts, using a “rough calculation” (ibid.), to rank in terms of importance the two components of the
overall error: sample bias and nonresponse bias, which, he estimates, account
for 11 points and 7 points, respectively (ibid.).22
The main difference between Squire’s article and Cahalan and Meier’s,
which has a direct bearing on the issue of sample bias and thus on the conventional explanation, is that Squire looked at the way telephone and automobile owners voted in 1936. He noted that the AIPO poll “overrepresents
the percentage of people who had a telephone or a car” (ibid.: 129). The
results, nevertheless, showed that “owners of only an automobile or a telephone were less supportive of Roosevelt than those who did not have either,
but they were still strongly for him. Even respondents who had both a car
and an automobile were for the president” (ibid.). The data presented by
Squire (ibid.: 130) indicated that, as a group, 61 percent of telephone and car
owners favored Roosevelt over Landon. Here was concrete evidence that the
conventional explanation, a mere conjecture, was wrong. If relying on telephone directories and car registration lists was not the problem, since owners
of these items favored Roosevelt, then the cause of the Digest poll’s blunder
must lie elsewhere.
But can these poll results be relied on to reach a valid conclusion? After
all, the AIPO survey was based on quota sampling, long frowned on by survey practitioners in the United States; in addition, this particular poll overrepresents Roosevelt voters as well as owners of telephones and automobiles.
Although, as Squire (ibid.: 129) pointed out, “This survey is the best avail-

34

Social Science History

able tool for determining why the Literary Digest poll failed,” the data collected should not be analyzed in raw form. In the next section I apply statistical techniques commonly used by survey data analysts nowadays to adjust
the data to known population values. Neither Cahalan and Meier nor Squire
attempted such an adjustment; hence the limitation of their conclusions.

A Reanalysis of the May 1937 Gallup Poll
Although Gallup polls of the 1930s and 1940s have been used by many scholars (e.g., Andersen 1979; Baum and Kernell 2001; Ladd and Hadley 1975)
and although pollsters in those days referred to them as “scientific,” they are
based on a sampling technique (quota control) that does not meet contemporary canons of sound statistical practice (probability sampling). Despite
this major flaw, Berinsky (2006: 509) believes that these data have “inherent
value” from which inferences can be drawn if the proper statistical methods
are used. Following in Berinsky’s footsteps, I rely on weighting techniques
that have long been used by survey data analysts.23 The general approach
adopted is known as poststratification weighting. It is commonly applied in
surveys to reduce any bias resulting from nonresponse and noncoverage; the
goal is to adjust the data so that they conform to known population values and
“to improve the precision of survey estimates” (Kalton and Flores-­Cervantes
2003: 81, 82). This section focuses on two primary issues: how telephone and
car owners voted and what the candidate preferences were among the original Digest list of 10 million.
In the first case, our reference population is the electorate: the population of voters (45.6 million in 1936). Here there is a problem, because in those
days the census did not yet conduct the Current Population Survey, with
its election-­year November supplement on registration and voting, nor did
the American National Election Studies or exit polls exist. In other words,
not all the variables in the analysis have “known population values.” I have
mentioned that the 1937 AIPO poll overestimates Roosevelt’s share of the
total popular vote (65.8 percent instead of 60.8 percent) and overrepresents
owners of telephones and owners of automobiles (51.7 percent instead of 33.1
percent and 61.0 percent instead of 57.0 percent, respectively).24 But this
overrepresentation of car and telephone owners is assessed with respect to
values in the general population, not the voting population. Thus the results
that I am about to present are based on (1) the assumption that the distri-

1936 Literary Digest Poll

35

bution of these consumer items are similar in both populations and (2) the
known distribution of votes for each presidential candidate. Further, these
results are obtained using a weighting method referred to as raking or iterative rim weighting.25 The purpose is to adjust the frequencies in the cells,
of which table 1 has 12 (3 rows × 4 columns), so that the marginal totals
(row totals and column totals) will conform to known population values. This
technique is used when the distribution of each variable (item ownership and
voting preference) is known but their joint distribution is unknown.
Table 1 shows that Roosevelt receives substantial majorities among two
of the three categories of car and telephone owners. Only among the owners
of both consumer goods does Landon have a lead.26 This is also the only
major difference between the weighted and unweighted data. The other
results are all in the same direction, although, unsurprisingly, Roosevelt’s
share of the vote is less than the original (unweighted) data imply. The main
conclusion is that, as a group, a majority of telephone and automobile owners
(53.9 percent) favored the incumbent president: this contradicts the conventional explanation and confirms the results presented by Squire (1988: 130).
Therefore reliance on telephone directories and automobile registration lists
cannot be the reason that the 1936 Digest presidential poll failed to forecast a
Roosevelt victory.
I focus now on the Digest sample based on the outcome of the AIPO’s
1937 poll. Table 2 indicates that Landon is ahead of Roosevelt among Digest
poll respondents but behind him among nonrespondents.27 Finally, the
results for the overall sample (respondents and nonrespondents combined),
that is, the original list of 10 million, show that Roosevelt is backed by a
majority. The reference population for this analysis is the original list (10
million) that the Digest used to send out its straw ballots for the 1936 presidential election. Given the available information regarding the Digest poll,
there are clear anomalies with the sample from the AIPO survey. First, the
response rate to the Digest poll, as reported by the AIPO, is 64 percent,
when in fact it should be 24 percent. In other words, the Gallup survey oversampled Digest respondents.28 The main task is to estimate how the original
Digest sample (the list of 10 million) would have voted in the straw poll; this
excess of respondents could bias the results, since, as table 2 shows, candidate preferences for respondents and nonrespondents are dissimilar. In other
words, if the raw results are not corrected, in effect too much weight is given
to respondents and not enough to nonrespondents. Furthermore, the results

on candidate preference among respondents are at variance with the actual
results of the Digest poll: in the latter Roosevelt received 42.9 percent of the
two-­party vote; here he gets 48.5 percent of the straw ballots.
As with the earlier analysis concerning car and phone owners, the raw
results must be weighted so that they conform to known population values.
But an awkward situation develops: the known information is a combination
of cell values (voting preference of Digest poll respondents) and marginal
totals (the overall response rate of the Digest poll). In other words, half the
cell frequencies in the two-­by-­two table (table 2) have to be estimated, but
raking cannot be used because some marginal totals (the row totals) are missing. The column totals can be adjusted to reflect the true response rate to the
Digest poll. Then, cell weighting can be used for the cells made up of respondents to the Digest poll, but not for the other half—the cells that correspond
to nonrespondents.29 For those cells, the compromise solution, in the absence
of better information, is to use the same correction factors that are applied to
the respondents’ cells and then adjust the results to conform to the corrected
column total for nonrespondents.
On the basis of these data, the following conclusions regarding the failure of the 1936 Digest poll can be reached:

38

Social Science History

1.

Had everybody on the original Digest list returned his or her straw ballot,
the magazine would have been in a position to forecast the correct winner of the election: Roosevelt.
2. Poll respondents and nonrespondents favored opposite candidates: while
three-­fifths of nonrespondents voted for the incumbent, only two-­fifths
of respondents did.
3. Landon’s supporters were much more likely to return their straw ballots
than Roosevelt’s: nearly one-­third versus only one-­fifth.
4. The bulk of the forecast error made by the Digest can be attributed to
nonresponse bias. Roosevelt’s actual share of the two-­party vote was 62.5
percent; his share as forecast by the Digest was 42.9 percent: a difference
of 19.6 points—that is the extent of the total error made by the Digest.
Referring back to table 2, this error can be partitioned into two additive
components: the portion due to sample bias (5.9 = 62.5 − 56.6) and the
portion resulting from nonresponse bias (13.7 = 56.6 − 42.9).
I will end this section by illustrating how the Digest poll gave the opportunity
for Landon supporters to vent their displeasure with the New Deal administration, irrespective of sociodemographic background.30
It has been said that the 1936 contest generated “the bitterest campaign
since 1896” (Hofstadter et al. 1959: 527).31 The New Deal, which had ruffled
many feathers, was accused, among other things, of being “socialistic,” the
ultimate anathema in the political culture of America. Feelings ran high in
certain quarters of the American electorate that “America [was] in peril” as
a result of the administration’s policies. It is no wonder, then, that highly
motivated individuals seized on the Digest poll to register their discontent
with the direction in which the administration was taking the country. These
respondents caused the downfall of the poll and, ultimately, of the Digest
itself.
Table 3 shows that the level of participation was higher among Landon’s
partisans than among Roosevelt’s supporters regardless of the ownership
category. Ironically, the highest turnout rate in favor of Landon was among
the “have-­nots” (40.5 percent), followed by the owners of both commodities (34.5 percent). The same pattern is present in table 4, which describes
the occupational status of the Digest sample: in all groups, even the unemployed, Landon supporters sent back their straw ballots at a higher rate. In
table 5 those who received the Digest ballot are classified into age groups.

One exception to the general pattern already observed occurs among those
21 to 24 years old: in that cohort, unlike all the others, Roosevelt supporters
returned their straw ballots at a higher rate (18.1 percent) than Landon followers (7.8 percent).
It is clear from these results that Landon supporters were far more motivated to participate in the Digest poll than backers of the incumbent president, and this motivation was somewhat more pronounced among higher-­
status occupational groups (professional, business, and skilled worker) and
older individuals than among the others, but ownership of a car or a telephone does not seem to have made much difference. Thus a combative opposition to Roosevelt and the policies he represented seems to have been, for
respondents, the central trigger to their participation in the poll, which provided a venue for these people to express a strong dislike of the New Deal.32

Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that the conventional explanation as
an account of the failure of the 1936 Digest poll is indeed a “myth” (Bryson
1976: 184). However, this research is by no means definitive, nor can it be:
we simply do not have the data to reach an unassailable conclusion. The only
sure way to make a final determination on this issue, according to contem-

porary canons of scientific practice, would be to select a probability sample
from the Digest list of 10 million, just as Cahalan did for Cedar Rapids; otherwise the empirical evidence presented and discussed here is the best we have.
As Squire (1988: 129) himself stated, the evidence is “less than perfect.” But
how serious are these imperfections?
I have already mentioned the issue of quota-­controlled sampling. It is
especially a problem, since, in those early days of “scientific” polling, interviewers were largely left to their own devices on how to go about filling their
quotas.33 We know that Gallup shaped his samples to be a miniature of the
voting population; to that end he deliberately undersampled certain individuals, such as women, blacks, and the poor. It is easy, when the information
is available, to compare AIPO samples to census data for the general population. The AIPO’s (1938: 9) samples were selected based on quotas for six
variables: proportion of voters represented by each state, area of residence
(urban and rural), gender, age, “income,” and party preference.34 The first

1936 Literary Digest Poll

41

and the last are the only two variables that can be compared to the actual distribution of voters. For this sample, the representation of voters by state is
fairly close: it overrepresents both the South by 1.4 points and New England
by 0.5 point; other regions—Middle Atlantic, Midwest/Central, and West—
are underrepresented by 1.7, 3.5, and 3.2 points, respectively. Given that this
sample was not designed specifically to forecast an election, the results are
remarkably accurate.35 The breakdown by area of residence is less accurate,
but the comparison is not based on the same populations: the AIPO sample
(urban: 64.7 percent; rural nonfarm: 15.7 percent; rural farm: 19.6 percent) is
intended to represent voters; the census data (urban: 56.4 percent; rural nonfarm: 20.1 percent; rural farm: 23.5 percent) is for the entire population (US
Bureau of the Census 1997: Series A-­73).36 The Gallup sample would seem
to overrepresent the urban portion of the population. The same comparative
asymmetry applies to gender and age. In the general population, the proportion of males (50.3 percent) and females (49.7 percent) aged 21 and older
is about even (US Bureau of the Census 1931: 20; 1943: 38); in the Gallup
sample, males (67.1 percent) outnumber females (32.9 percent) two to one. It
would appear that the 1937 AIPO poll substantially undersampled women.
But again, the population of interest is the electorate, not the general population: it is generally believed that women in those days did not participate
in elections as much as men—to what extent it is difficult to ascertain.37 If
the AIPO’s sample is gender biased, does it really matter? It does if men and
women voted differently in the presidential election. There appears to be no
scholarly consensus on these issues.38 In the 1937 sample, male voters seem
to favor Roosevelt slightly more (62.8 percent) than female voters (57.7 percent); although the difference is significant, it is not large, and both groups
favor the same candidate.39 If I compare the distribution of age categories (see
table 5) of the AIPO sample to census data (US Bureau of the Census 1997:
Series 31–37, 41), the two youngest (21–24 and 25–34) and the oldest (55+)
groups are underrepresented by 5.0, 0.8, and 4.3 points, respectively.40 As a
result, the other two age categories (35–44 and 45–54) are overrepresented
by 5.9 and 4.1 points, respectively.41 This is not surprising, given the oversampling of better-­off folks—those with a car or a telephone or both (see table 1).
Moreover, interviewers contributed to this process through their own social
biases. As one contemporary observer remarked: “The upward bias probably results in large part from the reluctance of middle-­class interviewers to
approach the lowest income groups” (Rugg 1947: 146). But how relevant is

this “bias toward the upper economic levels” (ibid.) in the AIPO samples to
the problem at hand? Under the conventional explanation assumption, one
would expect such a biased sample to display a distinct preference for the
Republican candidate. Instead, table 1 shows that the “haves” (owners of cars
and telephones) favored the incumbent president. However, this conclusion
is not valid if based on the raw data, because the sample overrepresents the
proportion of voters who favored him. In other words, the original sample
has too many “haves” and too many supporters of the president. This jeopardizes any inference regarding the candidate preference of car and telephone
owners. Indeed, although the overall excess in favor of Roosevelt (5.0 percent = 65.8 percent − 60.8 percent) is known, the overestimate in each cell is
not. Before I discuss this issue further, I will try to figure out the process that
gave rise to this situation.
Squire (1988: 129) explains this discrepancy as follows: “Like almost all
postelection surveys, it overestimates the vote for the winning candidate.” Is
that right? What Squire is suggesting is that a number of poll respondents
who voted for Landon in the November presidential election misreported
their voting preference for the poll. This can be done in three ways: deceptively (the respondents remember that they voted for Landon but choose to
report having voted for Roosevelt), deliberately (they cannot remember their

1936 Literary Digest Poll

43

choice but do not want to admit it and decide to report that they voted for
the winner), or involuntarily (the respondents believe that they voted for the
candidate they report on but actually voted for the opponent).42 According
to research done on vote choice, deception is unlikely; memory lapse is the
more common cause of misreports (Wright 1993: 292). The same study indicates that the rate of misreport in presidential elections is low (ibid.: 294,
310) compared to other electoral contests (Senate, House, governor). Thus
it would seem that what occurred with the 1937 AIPO poll is not so much a
misreport of candidate choice in favor of the winner as an oversampling of
Roosevelt supporters.43 Since the poll was not designed to predict an election, it is possible that interviewers were not as constrained to produce a
balanced sample along party lines as they would have been in a preelection
poll.44
The poststratification weighting strategy adopted in this article, which
is commonly used in probability samples to compensate for nonresponse
and noncoverage, rests on a leap of faith: that respondents are representative
of nonrespondents. In the case of Gallup’s samples, were those interviewed
similar to those of the same background who were passed over by the interviewers? Were the owners of cars and telephones interviewed by the AIPO
representative of voters of the same profile? Were those in the Gallup sample
who received the Digest ballot representative of those on the Digest’s original
list? We will never know, but I made the assumption that they are comparable
and used weighting techniques to correct for obvious biases.45
To resolve the issue of working with a sample that overrepresents both
the economically better-­off and the supporters of the incumbent, I relied on
iterative rim weighting. This statistical technique allows the user to estimate
the counts in the cells of the table that cross-­classifies ownership of a car or
a telephone with voting preference (table 1) so that cell frequencies will add
up to the marginal totals (known population values). Squire’s analysis of the
same data made no attempt to adjust ownership; as for voting preference, he
applied the marginal overestimate of Roosevelt (5 points) and underestimate
of Landon (4 points) to each corresponding cell in the table (Squire 1988:
130). This assumes that the over- and underselection of respondents was
the same for each category of ownership—a most unrealistic assumption.
Results in table 1 show that the oversampling of Roosevelt voters varied from
8.5 points for owners of both a car and a telephone to 6.6 points among the
“have-­nots,” while the underrepresentation of Landon voters varied from

44

Social Science History

8.0 to 5.4 points, respectively. My conclusions, however, are not fundamentally different from those reached by Squire in that a majority of automobile
and telephone owners voted for Roosevelt (53.9 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: 51.3, 56.5).
The same lack of statistical adjustment pervades the analysis of the
Digest poll as described by the Gallup sample: neither Cahalan and Meier
(1939) nor Squire (1988) used available auxiliary information to base their
analyses on sound statistical ground. Moreover, Squire’s (ibid.: 131) attempt
to partition the overall forecast error made by the Digest between what can
be accounted for by sample bias and what is related to nonresponse bias is
flawed: he computes this breakdown without taking into account the fact
that respondents are overrepresented. Since respondents and nonrespondents had very different candidate preferences (table 2), Squire’s estimate is
unsound.

Conclusions
This study had two related objectives: test empirically the validity of the conventional explanation and, if it proved wrong, find another explanation for
the Digest poll’s massive forecast error.
The conventional explanation, which assumes that, because the Digest
relied mainly on telephone books and car registration lists as its sampling
frame, the poll’s original sample had to be biased in favor of the Republican challenger, is mistaken. The data indicate that if the Digest had relied
entirely on these lists, it would have forecast Roosevelt as winning the election. Since the sampling frame was not to blame, another explanation was
required. Based on a sample of individuals who reported receiving a ballot from the Digest, the data show that nonrespondents, unlike respondents,
favored Roosevelt heavily and that a majority of the original list also supported him. In other words, nonresponse bias was the principal culprit for
the poll’s failure: if all the straw ballots from the initial Digest sample of 10
million had been returned instead of only 24 percent of them, the Digest poll
not only would have called the correct winner but would have done probably as well as two out of the three new “scientific” pollsters (Crossley and
Gallup: see Gallup 1972b: 215; Katz and Cantril 1937: 164).46 Roosevelt, who
got 62.5 percent of the two-­party vote, was predicted by the Gallup poll
to receive 55.7 percent (Gallup 1972b: 215), a 6.8 point underestimate; the

1936 Literary Digest Poll

45

data presented here (table 2) show that 56.6 percent (95 percent confidence
interval: 53.1, 60.1) of the Digest’s original list supported him—a 5.9 point
underestimate.
Despite the evidence uncovered by Squire, which should have caught
the attention of social science researchers and other writers who refer to
the Digest poll, the conventional explanation, “accepted by nearly everybody simply because nearly everybody repeats” it (Bryson 1977: 181), does
not seem to want to go away (e.g., among others, Fallacy Files n.d.; Kircher
2007; Saxon 2000). Like other myths, such as Isaac Newton’s apple, it has
acquired a life of its own; its popularity will be hard to dispel, because it has
this quality so well captured by the Italian expression “Se non è vero è ben
trovato” (Even if it’s not true, it’s still a good story). The more this “explanation” is repeated, the more its factual status is enhanced. It has considerable intuitive appeal: it is easily remembered and has a distinct ring of truth.
It is also important that its pedigree can be traced back to such an authority
as Gallup: that makes it almost ironclad. From the outset, however, it was a
conjecture and required empirical evidence to be confirmed or rejected. The
May 1937 AIPO poll has provided the data to test this hypothesis.47 I found
that the evidence contradicted the assumptions associated with the conventional explanation.
Are the limited and imperfect data presented in this study preferable to
mere conjecture? Aside from the 1937 AIPO poll, we have the Digest poll’s
results from three cities (Allentown, Scranton, and Chicago) in which only
registered voters were sampled: all suffered from low response rates, and
all favored Landon (like the national sample). There is also the probability-­
based survey conducted by Cahalan shortly after the election in Cedar
Rapids: there again, Landon was favored by respondents. Furthermore, the
data show that nonrespondents preferred Roosevelt and that the list used by
the Digest for that city was unbiased. What is remarkable about these sets of
results is their consistency: they all show that nonresponse bias was the primary cause of the Digest poll’s massive error. This is what one might call a
“confluence of evidence” (Ziesel 1985: 252).
For social scientists who rely on sample surveys as their source of data,
the lesson from the Digest is that any poll or survey that has a low response
rate is probably biased. It is ironic that, in this age of the Worldwide Web,
many polling houses rely on huge Internet “panels” that bring to mind the
size of the original list of the Digest.48 These panels, just like the Digest list,

46

Social Science History

suffer from noncoverage (a nontrivial portion of US households is still not
connected to the Internet). Organizations that use a combination of probability sampling and the Web to collect their data are fraught with low response
rates. Of course, nowadays they have at their disposal a wide array of statistical tools49 and population figures to adjust the data once the field period of
the survey is over.
The second lesson that can be derived from this study merely reiterates
what Berinsky (2006) has already suggested: social scientists who use poll
results from the 1930s and 1940s are well advised to adjust the data to known
population parameters when these are available from the census.
In conclusion, the available empirical evidence I have reviewed suggests
that the principal cause of the 1936 Literary Digest poll fiasco was most probably nonresponse bias: the result of a low response rate (24 percent) combined with a very large difference in candidate preference between Digest poll
respondents, who heavily favored Alf Landon, the Republican challenger,
and nonrespondents, who in turn strongly supported the incumbent president, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The Digest did not use its own subscriber list as part of the sample (Literary Digest
1928: 7).
Unless otherwise indicated, all the quotes that follow are taken from this issue of the
Literary Digest 1936d: 7–8.
However, the editor, Wilfred J. Funk, was quoted in the New York Times (1936) as saying that “we may not have reached a cross-­section of the population in distributing
our ballots.” Ironically, Gallup (1938: 139) admitted the same as one factor explaining his underestimate of Roosevelt’s share of the vote: “We under-­estimated lower
income groups in our sample.”
In the same article, a few pages later, Stephan (1939: 348) writes: “Experience in
questionnaire inquiries has shown that persons who return questionnaires differ in
some important characteristics from those who do not and consequently a sample
composed of such persons may be badly biassed [sic]. The unfortunate experience of
the Literary Digest was principally due to this factor” (emphasis added). This directly
contradicts the statement quoted above.
As one author states, Gallup was the main promoter of “the popular notion that the
[Digest] poll failed because of biases in the sample” (Grier 2002: 32).
The author relies on Gallup and Rae 1940.
Erikson and Tedin (1981: 953) add an original twist to the conventional explanation,
although they offer no empirical evidence for it. They argue that the 1936 Digest list
was made even more biased because its reduction from 20 million to 10 million was
done at “the expense of the less affluent.”
In fairness to Converse, her book was published a year before Squire 1988. However,
in Converse 2009, a reprint that includes a new introduction, no change regarding
this issue is mentioned.
Eight percent refused, and another 12 percent could not be reached. The effective
sample size was n = 554.
They compared the distribution of the demographic variables in the Digest list to
census data of the general population. The authors do not mention that this is not an
entirely valid comparison, since the Digest list was purported to represent the voting
population.
See table 1 in Cahalan and Meir 1939: 6. Roosevelt received 63 percent of the two-­
party vote, so there is a 7-­point bias (63 − 56) in the original Digest list based on the
raw results of the Gallup poll.
A search on Google Scholar (May 22, 2010) reveals 10 citations of this work: 3 in the
1940s, 1 in the 1950s, 2 in the 1970s, 1 in the 1980s, 1 in the 1990s, and 2 in the first
decade of the 2000s. Only one of these citations (Cahalan 1989) discusses the cause
of the Digest’s poll blunder.
In the article’s abstract Squire (1988: 125) states: “No empirical research has been
conducted to determine why the poll failed.” Later in the article he writes that the
AIPO poll “has never, to my knowledge, been exploited” (ibid.: 128).
In that article Cahalan (1989: 129) states that his “conclusions in 1938 were the same
as Squire’s in 1988.” He comments mostly on his Cedar Rapids study but never

directly addresses the issue of the Digest’s sampling frame (telephone directories and
automobile registration lists).
This estimate is incorrect, because it is based on a sample that gives too much weight
to respondents heavily in favor of Landon. The next section shows that Squire’s conclusion on this matter is wrong.
These methods have been around since the 1940s. See Deming 1964 [1943]; Deming
and Stephan 1940; and Stephan 1942.
The official reference for the May 1937 poll is USAIPO1937-­0083 (Roper Center for
Public Opinion Research 2003b). I assume that each poll participant represents one
household. For the telephone percentage: US Bureau of the Census 1997: Series R3.
For automobiles: Fischer 1992: 102; US Bureau of the Census 1997: Series Q153.
For a description of the raking process, see Berinsky 2006: 513 and Kalton and
Flores-­Cervantes 2003: 86. It is iterative because it usually takes several iterations
(of computations) before the sum of the cells (the intersections of rows and columns)
converge to the marginal totals that are the targets.
The difference between Landon and Roosevelt is not statistically significant in this
category (see table 1 note).
For the purpose of this analysis, only the two-­party vote is relevant.
This is not surprising, since the survey also oversampled car and telephone owners.
Cell weighting is used when the joint distribution of the variables is known. Here the
joint distribution for one value of one dichotomous variable (respondents) and for
two values of the other variable (candidate choice: Roosevelt or Landon) are known.
The data in tables 3–5 are weighted.
My remarks are based on these authors’ assessment of the 1936 election and the New
Deal.
The Digest was not the only straw poll that favored Landon: so did the Farm Journal
and the Autocasters Grass Roots poll (Crossley 1937: 24). Moreover, the response
rate to the Digest poll in 1936 was 24 percent, up from 15 percent in 1932. Finally,
if the 1936 respondents’ vote recall of their 1932 vote had been used to describe the
1932 election, Roosevelt would have received 48 percent of the vote instead of the
57 percent he garnered, indicating an excess of Republican respondents. These facts
suggest that Landon backers were highly motivated.
For a description of these issues, see Igo 2006: 118–20.
Age was often too sensitive to ask directly (Igo 2006: 119). Income was never asked
directly; the interviewer had to ascertain whether the respondent was above, at, or
below average or on relief. Moreover, there are no census data on income in those
years.
The sample used by Gallup for his electoral polls (1936) was considerably larger than
that used for issue polls like the May 1937 one analyzed in this study (n = 2,945, of
which n = 2,885 represent voters). According to one source, Gallup used a sample of
n =125,000 for his electoral forecast of November 1936 (Robinson 1937: 48).
All 1936 values presented here are obtained by linear interpolation based on figures
from the 1930 and 1940 censuses.

Willcox (1931: 245) states that men were 60 percent of the voters. He spent part of
his career at the Bureau of the Census (Leonard 1961: 16).
See Alpern and Baum 1985; Andersen 1979: 22, 40; Kleppner 1982; and Ogburn and
Goltra 1919. Most of this research deals with the 1920s, not the 1930s.
The results are weighted (raking) using Willcox’s estimate on gender. See n. 37.
Based on the poll’s raw results, among the voters aged 21 to 34, Roosevelt is favored
by more than two to one over Landon; among the oldest, aged 55+, “only” 54 percent say that they voted for him.
The census age distribution is: 21–24 = 11.4 percent; 25–34 = 25.7 percent; 35–44 =
22.3 percent; 45–54 = 18.2 percent; 55+ = 22.5 percent.
I assume that the individuals in question were all voters. Of the original sample (n =
2,945) for the May 1937 poll, 76.8 percent are declared voters; 9.1 percent stated that
they did not vote; 3.6 percent chose not to answer the question; 9.6 percent were too
young to vote; and 0.8 percent were of undetermined age (16 voted for Roosevelt,
7 voted for Landon, and 1 did not vote)—these last were excluded from the analysis.
I assume here that voters in the 1930s and those in the 1950s through the 1980s
(Wright’s time series) behave similarly. Wright (1993: 310) notes that the “bandwagon
effect” is more likely to occur right after the election and that it decreases with time.
The poll did not include a presidential performance question. Two other questions
dealt with the presidency. One (question 2) asked respondents whether Congress
should pass “the President’s Supreme Court plan” (Roper Center for Public Opinion Research 2003a: 3): 58 percent said no (Gallup and Robinson 1938: 378). The
second (question 7) asked respondents whether they would vote for Roosevelt if
he were a candidate “for a third term in 1940” (Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research 2003a: 3): only 35 percent said yes, 45 percent said no, and 20 percent were
undecided or had no opinion. The question regarding vote choice in the 1936 presidential election was the last one asked in the survey (question 9).
Berinsky (2006: 516) writes rather optimistically: “There is no reason to suspect that
the members of deliberately underrepresented groups—such as women and southerners—who were interviewed were systematically different from the members of
those groups who were not interviewed. . . . After all, the sample imbalance exists
because the pollsters deliberately drew nonrepresentative samples based on these
characteristics.” Berinsky misuses the word draw. Pollsters in those days did not
“draw” samples; they set quotas and gave their interviewers instructions on how to
fill them.
The Roper poll, carried out under the auspices of Fortune magazine, came within
1 point of the actual total. Unlike the other two polls (Crossley and Gallup), it was
based on a national sample as opposed to an aggregate of state samples.
Gallup never used the data from this poll when discussing the Digest poll (this “oversight” is the topic of another study in progress), as he did so often, and Cahalan, who
went to work for Gallup shortly after graduating from Iowa (Ohmer 2006: 82), never
mentioned the results regarding the voting preference of automobile and telephone
owners.
