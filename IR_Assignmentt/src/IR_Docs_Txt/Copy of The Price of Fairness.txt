that the question of what it means to be fair has been
addressed extensively in the economics literature over the
last century. In particular, see Young (1995) and Sen and
Foster (1997) for a thorough overview of this work. Fair
ness also plays a critical role in the selection of an appro
priate social welfare function in welfare economics (see
Mas-Colell et al. 1995). The notions of fairness we focus
on in this work are perhaps among the most prominently
studied notions of fairness in the economics literature;

and max-min fairness see Nash (1950) and Kalai and
Smorodinsky (1975), respectively.

with m = 4. Assume that the utility derived by each player
is equal to the square-root of the sum of the fractions of
each resource allocated to him (i.e., fj(x) — ^JxAJ + xBj for
y = l,2). The utility set in this case is thus

Returning to our general formulation, the CDM's prob

of equal
maximum achievable utilities is not overly restrictive: the

utility levels of the players are commonly normalized in a
variety of settings so that the comparison between them is
meaningful. Under normalization, the maximum achievable
utility of each player typically is equal to 1.

• Our results show that for a small number of players,
the price of fairness stays relatively low. In particular, these

results establish that for Nash's original two-player bargain

ing game (i.e., n = 2), the price of fairness is at most 8.6%
for proportional fairness and 11.1% for max-min fairness!

For n — 5, these numbers are 30.6% and 44.4%, respec
tively. This suggests that in cases with a relatively small
number of players, the central decision maker can achieve
fair allocations without incurring a high reduction in the
sum of utilities. For illustration, Table 1 lists the values for
the worst-case bounds under the two schemes for a small

number of players.

We now generalize the result of the previous section for the

bounds for the price of fairness. Recall that the maximum

Similar tight bounds can be derived for an even number of

To obtain a tight upper bound for the case of proportional
fairness, we study a similar setup but with additional long
flows. In particular, let the number of long flows be equal
to k2 — k (instead of k — 1). Thus, there are now n = k2
flows. Let also M = 1.

The utilitarian solution remains unchanged in this case,
with the CDM allocating unit rate to the first k flows.

This paper has attempted to quantify the "price" one has

ciency loss incurred in using either of two widely accepte
and axiomatically justified notions of fairness—max-min
fairness and proportional fairness. It is our belief that t

< k(eTe — k) = 0.

"price" of fairness is effectively inescapable if the al
