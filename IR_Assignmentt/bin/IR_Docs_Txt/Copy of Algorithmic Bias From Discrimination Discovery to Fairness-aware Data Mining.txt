ABSTRACT

1.

Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in all aspects of our daily lives lives (offline
and online), as they have become essential tools in personal
finance, health care, hiring, housing, education, and policies. It is therefore of societal and ethical importance to ask
whether these algorithms can be discriminative on grounds
such as gender, ethnicity, or health status. It turns out that
the answer is positive: for instance, recent studies in the context of online advertising show that ads for high-income jobs
are presented to men much more often than to women [5];
and ads for arrest records are significantly more likely to
show up on searches for distinctively black names [16].
This algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discrimination intention in the developer of the algorithm. Sometimes it may be inherent to the data sources used (software making decisions based on data can reflect, or even
amplify, the results of historical discrimination), but even
when the sensitive attributes have been suppressed from the
input, a well trained machine learning algorithm may still
discriminate on the basis of such sensitive attributes because
of correlations existing in the data. These considerations
call for the development of data mining systems which are
discrimination-conscious by-design. This is a novel and challenging research area for the data mining community.
The aim of this tutorial is to survey algorithmic bias, presenting its most common variants, with an emphasis on the
algorithmic techniques and key ideas developed to derive efficient solutions. The tutorial covers two main complementary approaches: algorithms for discrimination discovery
and discrimination prevention by means of fairness-aware
data mining. We conclude by summarizing promising paths
for future research.

At the beginning of 2014, as an answer to the growing
concerns about the role played by data mining algorithms in
decision-making, USA President Obama called for a review
of big data collecting and analysing practices. The resulting
report1 concluded that “big data technologies can cause societal harms beyond damages to privacy.” In particular, it
expressed concerns about the possibility that decisions informed by big data could have discriminatory effects, even
in the absence of discriminatory intent, further imposing less
favorable treatment to already disadvantaged groups.
In the data mining community, the effort to design
discrimination-conscious methods has developed two groups
of solutions: (1) techniques for discrimination discovery
from databases [13] and (2) discrimination prevention by
means of fairness-aware data mining, developing data mining systems which are discrimination-conscious by-design
[8]. Discrimination discovery in databases consists in the
actual discovery of discriminatory situations and practices
hidden in a large amount of historical decision records. Discrimination prevention in data mining consists of ensuring
that data mining models automatically extracted from a
data set are such that they do not lead to discriminatory
decisions even if the data set is inherently biased against
protected groups. Different discrimination prevention methods have been proposed considering different data mining
algorithms such as naı̈ve bayes models, logistic regression,
decision trees, hinge loss, support vector machines, adaptive
boosting, classification, and rule and pattern mining. Three
approaches are conceivable for discrimination prevention:
preprocessing by means of transforming the source data; inprocessing by means of integrating the anti-discrimination
constrains in the design of algorithm; postprocessing by
means of modifying the results of data mining models.

The tutorial is at researchers interested in the technical
aspects behind the societal and ethical problems of discrimination and privacy introduced by data mining and machine
learning algorithms. No special knowledge is assumed other
than familiarity with algorithmic techniques from a standard
computer science background.

INTRODUCTION

INTENDED AUDIENCE

OUTLINE

The tutorial is structured in three main technical parts,
plus a concluding part where we discuss future research

data privacy report may 1 2014.pdf

agenda. All three technical parts include both theory and
real-world applications.
1. Introduction, context, and fundamental results:
Motivation and examples of algorithmic bias; sources
of algorithmic bias; legal definitions and principles of
discrimination; relationship with privacy [1, 4].
2. Discrimination discovery: Measures of discrimination; data analysis techniques for discrimination
discovery (multidisciplinary approaches in the economic, legal, and statistical domains); data mining approaches for discrimination discovery including classification rules, K-NN, bayesian networks, probabilistic
causation and privacy attack strategies; case studies
in crime suspect dataset and scientific project evaluation; online discrimination discovery including search,
ad delivery, and price discrimination; tools including
DCUBE and FairTest [13, 12, 14, 2].
3. Fairness-aware data mining: Pre-processing approaches including correcting the training data; inprocessing approaches including naı̈ve bayes models,
logistic regression, decision trees, hinge loss, support vector machines, adaptive boosting and classification; post-processing approaches including classification, rule and pattern mining; simultaneous discrimination prevention and privacy protection considering
k-anonymity, t-closeness and differential privacy models [3, 8, 11, 7, 6, 10, 9].
4. Challenges and directions for future research.
