Meta-analysis
Bias in location and selection of studies
Matthias Egger, George Davey Smith
Meta-analysis has received a mixed reception since the
outset. Some people have rejected what they see as exercises in “mega-silliness,”1 while the purveyors of a highly
distinguished series of meta-analyses of perinatal medical care2 have been dismissed as “an obstetrical BaaderMeinhof gang.”3 To some clinicians objecting to the
findings of meta-analyses, “a tool has become a
weapon.”4 At the other end of the spectrum, the application of a technique that basically consists of calculating a
weighted average has been hailed as “Newtonian,”5 and it
has been suggested that meta-analysis has left no place
for the narrative review article.6 The truth is likely to lie
somewhere between these extreme views.
That meta-analysis holds potential problems can
be illustrated by contrasting the conclusions of two
meta-analyses comparing low molecular weight
heparins and standard heparin in the prevention of
thrombosis after surgery.7 8 One group concluded that
“low molecular weight heparins seem to have a higher
benefit to risk ratio than unfractionated heparin in
preventing perioperative thrombosis,”7 whereas the
other considered that “there is at present no
convincing evidence that in general surgery patients
low molecular weight heparins, compared with
standard heparin, generate a clinically important
improvement in the benefit to risk ratio.”8 Various
differences exist between these meta-analyses, but the
main difference relates to the selection of studies for
inclusion (table). Nurmohamed et al based their analysis on a subgroup of trials that they considered to
possess the highest methodological strength,8 while
Leizorovicz et al included all trials in their analysis.7
The table shows that many other elements—for

Summary points
Bias can be introduced in many ways into the
process of locating and selecting studies for
inclusion in meta-analysis
Studies with significant results are more likely to
get published than studies without significant
results, leading to publication bias
Among published studies, those with significant
results are more likely to get published in English,
more likely to be cited, and more likely to be
published repeatedly, leading to English language
bias, citation bias, and multiple publication bias
In less developed countries, studies with
significant results may be more likely to get
published in a journal indexed in a literature
database, which can introduce database bias
Criteria for including studies in a meta-analysis
may be influenced by knowledge of the results of
the set of potential studies, leading to inclusion bias
The likely presence or absence of bias should be
routinely examined in sensitivity analyses and
funnel plots

Publication bias
The most obvious problem is that some studies never
get published. If the reasons that studies remain
unpublished are associated with their outcome then
the result of a meta-analysis could be seriously biased.
Hypothetically, with a putative treatment that has no
actual effect on a disease, studies suggesting a
beneficial effect might end up being published, while
an equal mass of data pointing the other way might
remain unpublished. In this situation a meta-analysis of
the published trials would identify a spurious beneficial
treatment effect. In the field of cancer chemotherapy
this has indeed been shown, in a comparison of the
results from studies identified in a literature search with
those contained in an international trials registry9
(box).
Such publication bias has been a matter of concern
in education research and psychology for over 30
years.10-12 Work on the existence and importance of
publication bias in the medical literature is more
recent. Five separate studies have investigated this by
following up research proposals approved by ethics
committees.13-16 Of 285 studies approved by one
research ethics committee between 1984 and 1987 that
had been completed and analysed, 138 (48%) had been
published by 1990. Studies with significant (P < 0.05)
results were more likely to have been published than
those with non-significant results.13 A meta-analysis of
all five studies shows that this is a consistent finding,

Bias in location of studies
Although publication bias has long been recognised10
and much discussed,20 21 other factors can contribute to
biased inclusion of studies in meta-analyses. Indeed,
among published studies the probability of identifying
relevant trials for meta-analysis is also influenced by
their results. These biases have received much less consideration than publication bias, but their consequences could be equally important.

Fig 1 Meta-analysis of five studies examining association of

with little heterogeneity between studies (fig 1). The
odds of publishing results were three times greater if
the results were significant (combined odds ratio 3.0,
95% confidence intervals 2.3 to 3.9), and such
publication bias was found for both clinical trials and
observational studies. Interestingly, studies continue to
appear in print many years after approval by the ethics
committee. Stern et al (ethics committee E) found that
about 85% of studies with significant results compared
with 65% of studies with null results had been
published after 10 years.16 The median time to
publication was 4.8 years for studies with significant
results and 8.0 years for studies with null results.
The source of funding was associated with
publication or non-publication independently of study
results.13 14 16 Studies sponsored by the pharmaceutical
industry were less likely to be published than those
supported by the government or by voluntary organisations, with investigators citing the data management
by these companies as a reason for non-publication.13 14
This is in agreement with a review of publications of
clinical trials that grouped them into those which were
sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry and those
supported by other means.17 The results of 89% of
published industry-supported trials favoured combination chemotherapy over monotherapy with an alkylating agent, compared with 61% of the other trials.
Similar results have been reported from an overview of
trials of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.18 The
implication is that the pharmaceutical industry
discourages the publication of studies that it has
funded which have negative findings. Finally, multicentre studies were more likely to be published than studies from a single centre.14 However, high quality trials
were not more likely to be published than trials of
lower quality.13
Selective submission of papers rather than selective
acceptance of papers by journals seems to be the
dominant contributor to publication bias.13-16 However,
that selective acceptance does occur is illustrated by the
“instructions to authors” section of one major journal
on diabetes, which stated that “mere confirmation of
known facts will be accepted only in exceptional cases;
the same applies to reports of experiments and observations having no positive outcome.”19 Many authors
may not submit studies with negative findings because
they anticipate rejection.

English language bias
Meta-analyses published in English language journals
are often exclusively based on trials published in English. For example, of 36 meta-analyses published in
leading English language general medical journals
from 1991 to 1993, 26 had restricted their search to
studies reported in English.22 Investigators working in a

research output28 and that its medical research is published in English. Studies that are published in journals
not indexed in one of the major databases means that
these data are effectively hidden from reviewers and
meta-analysts. A minority of trials will be published in
indexed local or international journals, but results and
other characteristics are likely to differ between these
two groups. Indeed, trials with significant results might
be more likely to be published in an indexed journal,
whereas trials with null results are published in
non-indexed journals.

non-English speaking country will, however, publish
some of their work in local journals.23-25 Authors might
be more likely to report positive findings in an
international, English language journal and negative
findings in a local journal. Bias could thus be
introduced in meta-analyses based exclusively on
reports in English.22 24
We have examined this issue for literature published
in German. All randomised controlled trials published
in five German, Swiss, and Austrian general medical
journals from 1985 to 1994 were identified in a manual
search.25 The Medline database was then searched for
randomised controlled trials published in English
during the same 10 year period.26 Comparison of pairs
of articles published by the same first author found that
63% of trials published in English had produced significant (P < 0.05) results, compared with 35% of trials published in German. In logistic regression analysis the
odds for publication in English were 3.8 (95%
confidence interval 1.3 to 11.3) times higher if the results
were significant. This association was little changed
when adjusted for study sample size, design, and quality.
Indeed, quality scores were closely similar for English
and German language reports.26 These findings show
that for publications of randomised trials from German
speaking Europe, an English language bias does exist
and that ignoring trials published in German is
problematic. The same situation is likely in relation to
other languages, particularly European languages.
Database bias
Whereas most of the major west European journals
that are published in languages other than English are
indexed in Embase or Medline, this is not the case for
journals published in less developed countries. Among
the 3000 to 4000 journals indexed by Medline,
Embase, or the Science Citation Index, only about 2%
are from the less developed world.27 For example, only
30 journals out of a total of 3861 journals indexed in
Medline are published in India, despite the fact that
India is the developing country with the largest
BMJ VOLUME 316

Citation bias
In locating studies, researchers often supplement
searches of computerised databases by contacting
experts in the field and checking the reference lists of
other studies and reviews. When reference lists are
used, citation bias could have an important role. In the
field of cholesterol lowering, trials that are supportive
of a beneficial effect are cited more frequently than
unsupportive trials, regardless of the size and quality of
the studies involved29 (box). Thus the use of reference
lists would be more likely to locate supportive studies,
which could bias the findings of a meta-analysis.
The journals in which papers are published could
also influence the ease of their location and their inclusion in meta-analyses. One influential cholesterol lowering trial, for example, was originally planned as a
study with primary prevention and secondary prevention arms.34 The results of the primary prevention
component were interpreted by the investigators as
being favourable, and the results were published in the
New England Journal of Medicine in 1987.35 The secondary prevention arm finished at the same time, but in
this case the results were clearly unfavourable.36 The
findings from this arm were not published until 1993,
in the Annals of Medicine,36 a journal with limited circulation. The paper in the New England Journal of Medicine
received more than 450 citations in the three years
after publication, whereas the article in the Annals of
Medicine received 17.
Multiple publication bias
Multiple publications from single studies can lead to
bias in several ways.37 Studies with significant results are
more likely to lead to multiple publications and
presentations,13 which makes it more likely that they
will be located and included in a meta-analysis.
Furthermore, the inclusion of duplicated data may lead
to overestimation of treatment effects, as recently
shown for trials of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor
antagonist that is used for prevention and treatment of
postoperative nausea and vomiting.38 It is not always
obvious that multiple publications come from a single
study, and one set of study participants may thus be
included in an analysis twice. This is a particular problem in multicentre trials. In one of the meta-analyses of
low molecular weight heparin,8 for example, it seems
that combined data from a multicentre trial were
included, together with a subset of the same data that
had also been reported separately from an individual
centre which contributed to the trial.39 Indeed, it may
be difficult, if not impossible, for meta-analysts to
determine whether two papers represent duplicate
publications of one trial or two separate trials, as exam63

Bias in provision of data
Some additional data not reported in print are often
needed for meta-analysis—for example, in the case of
reports that do not provide adequate stratification of
data—but it may prove difficult to obtain this
information. Many factors could influence the willingness of investigators to make their data available, but
one element could be the direction of the results. Such
provision of data bias could also occur in the case of
unpublished trials or trials published only as
conference abstracts.

Biased inclusion criteria

No of patients

Although studies might have been located and data
obtained, potential for bias might still arise in establishing the inclusion criteria for a meta-analysis. If, as is
usual, the inclusion criteria are developed by an investigator familiar with the area under study, the criteria can
be influenced by knowledge of the results of the set of
potential studies. Manipulating the inclusion criteria
could lead to selective inclusion of studies with positive
findings and exclusion of studies with negative findings.
For example, some meta-analyses of trials of cholesterol
lowering treatment have excluded certain studies on the
4000

3000

2000

grounds that the treatments used seem to have had an
adverse effect independent of cholesterol lowering
itself.41 42 These meta-analyses have, however, included
trials of treatments that are likely to influence favourably
the risk of coronary heart disease, independent of
cholesterol lowering. Clearly such an asymmetrical
approach introduces the possibility of selection bias,
with the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis being
derived from the results of the studies (see box on
citation and selection bias).
A more recent example relates to a meta-analysis of
trials of dietary interventions in community settings.43
The authors excluded a trial because the randomisation process was considered to be inadequate, but they
included a duplicate publication of the same trial with
an almost identical description of the randomisation
procedure.44 Two independent observers assessed
eligibility of trials, with disagreements being resolved
by a third author. This example shows how vulnerable
the selection process can be in meta-analysis.

Examining for bias
The most appropriate way of handling the selection of
studies is to include all studies that meet basic entry
criteria then perform sensitivity analyses with regard to
the different possible entry criteria. Any conclusions
from a meta-analysis that are highly sensitive to
altering the entry criteria should be treated with
caution. In addition to such sensitivity analyses, the
likely presence or absence of bias should be examined
graphically in funnel plots.
Funnel plots
Funnel plots—simple scatterplots of the trials’ effect
estimates against their sample size—are useful to detect
A demonstration of publication bias
• Studies with significant results are more likely to get
published than those with non-significant results
• The inclusion of a study in a trials register can be
assumed not to be influenced by its results because
registration generally takes place before completion of
the study
• The studies enlisted in a register are therefore likely
to constitute a more representative sample of all the
studies that have been performed in a given area than
a sample of published studies
• This principle has been tested for trials of different
cancer chemotherapies by comparing the results from
meta-analysis of trials identified in a literature search
and of trials registered with the International Cancer
Research Data Bank (figure)9

bias in meta-analysis.45 The funnel plot is based on the
fact that precision in estimating the underlying
treatment effect will increase as the sample size of
component studies increases. Results from small studies will scatter widely at the bottom of the graph. The
spread will narrow as precision increases among larger
studies. In the absence of bias, the plot should thus
resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel. If the plot
shows an asymmetrical and skewed shape, bias may be
present. This usually takes the form of a gap in the wide
part of the funnel, which indicates the absence of small
studies showing no benefit or harm. The funnel plot is
a graphical test for any type of bias that is associated
with sample size (box). The publication and location
biases described in this article are more likely to affect
smaller studies than large trials and may thus lead to
funnel plot asymmetry. Another source of asymmetry
arises from differences in the methodological quality.
Smaller studies are, on average, conducted and
analysed with less methodological rigour than larger
studies, and trials of lower quality tend to show larger
effects.46 Statistical methods that provide an objective
measure of funnel plot asymmetry have recently
become available.45 47
An example—â blockers after myocardial infarction
In this series we have repeatedly discussed a
meta-analysis of 17 trials assessing â blockers in
secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. The
sensitivity analysis that we presented earlier48 showed
that the results were robust to the choice of the statistiCitation and selection of studies bias
A meta-analysis of seven trials of cholesterol lowering
after myocardial infarction30 defined its inclusion
criteria as single-factor randomised trials with at least
100 participants per group, with at least three years of
follow up, and without the use of hormone treatment
to lower cholesterol. The pooled results for all cause
mortality showed a favourable trend (odds ratio 0.91,
95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.02) (figure).
One trial met all the entry criteria but was not
included.31 In this study the odds ratio for overall
mortality was an unfavourable 1.60 (0.95 to 2.70). For
the trials included in the analysis the mean annual
citation count per study for the period up to five years
after publication was 20; for the study that was not
included it was less than 1.29 Citation bias may thus
have distorted the results of this meta-analysis.
Eleven other secondary prevention trials were
available at the time but did not meet the somewhat
arbitrary inclusion criteria.32 The pooled odds ratio for
all cause mortality for these trials is 1.14 (1.03 to 1.26).
Inclusion biases may thus have influenced the
conclusions of this meta-analysis.
Trials

cal method and to the exclusion of trials of lesser quality or of studies terminated early. The funnel plot is
shown in figure 2. Visual assessment shows some
asymmetry, which indicates that there was selective
non-publication of smaller trials with less sizeable benefit. However, in formal statistical analysis45 47 the
degree of asymmetry is found to be small and
non-significant (P > 0.1). Furthermore, exclusion of the
smaller studies had little effect on the overall estimate.48
Bias does not therefore seem to have distorted the
findings from this meta-analysis.

Conclusions
Biases in publication, location, and inclusion are a
potentially serious problem in meta-analysis49-51 Critical examination for the presence of such biases in sensitivity and funnel plot analyses should therefore form
an integral part of meta-analyses.45 The effort of the
Cochrane Collaboration to identify as many controlled
trials as possible through manual searches of a large
number of medical journals published in many different languages is of great importance to reduce such
bias. Indeed, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register52
is nowadays likely to be the best single source of
published trials for inclusion in systematic reviews and
meta-analyses. To eliminate the risk of publication bias,
however, trials need to be registered at the time they
are established. To ensure registration, the ethical
approval of studies could be linked to a requirement
that trials are reported to a central register.33 49 53
Furthermore, results of completed trials could be submitted to the ethical committee, the reports could be
kept centrally, and requests for unpublished trials
could be sent to this body. At present, however, much
effort is still needed to ensure that the set of studies
located for a meta-analysis is not a biased sample of all
existing studies.

Lessons from history
Be cautious when choosing your specialty
“Men die of the diseases which they have studied most ...
it’s as if the morbid condition was an evil creature which,
when it found itself closely hunted, flew at the throat of
its pursuer.” 1 This warning introduces a tale by Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle (ophthalmologist, historian,
creator of Sherlock Holmes), wherein the fate of a
neurologist, named Walker, is described. He developed
locomotor ataxia, the early signs of which he noticed
during a lecture on the said malady. Later, Doyle tells us
that “there was of course the well-known instance of
Liston and the aneurism, and a dozen others.” 1
Reclining one evening in indifferent mood, I became
burdened by the sobriety of this concept. I recalled an
acquaintance, a vascular surgeon, who succumbed to a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. There followed
apace, the ironic remembrance of a urologist who
developed prostatic carcinoma, which caused his
demise. Upon quiet discussion with a colleague,
curiosity spurred us to look further, to explore the
veracity of this sombre association. On browsing
through Hamilton Bailey’s text, an enigmatic footnote
lent support for this whimsical notion. It describes the
unenviable fate of Armand Trousseau (1801-1867),
whose self diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was
suggested by his development of Trousseau’s sign
(migrating thrombophlebitis), the implications of
which he had previously described.2 Further searching
vindicated Doyle’s counsel.
Duchenne (1806-1875), a founder of French
neurology and Tooth (1856-1925), a neurologist at
Saint Bartholomew’s, both died of cerebrovascular
accidents, an ironic punishment for intellects that
battled against cerebral disorders.3 Hansell

66

(1917-1973), a chest physician, was stricken by
pulmonary tuberculosis while still a student.
Undaunted, he devoted himself to studying the disease
which eventually consumed him.4 Hamilton Young, a
urologist, died of renal cell carcinoma.5 Werdnig
(1844-1919), a neurologist, developed spastic
paraparesis which left him bedridden, culminating in
his death.3
Broadening the concept to include less direct modes
of death strengthens the proposition. Schilder
(1886-1940), a psychiatrist, was capable of becoming
completely distracted by his inner thoughts. He was
killed by a motor car, probably in such a detached
state.3 Gilles de la Tourette (1855-1904), a neurologist,
was partial to administering unusual treatment
modalities for psychiatric ailments. He was shot in the
head by a paranoid patient, after which he suffered
manic depressive illness. His subsequent psychiatric
disturbance necessitated his detention at Lausanne
Mental Hospital till his death.3 Without submitting
such a delicate subject to statistical analysis, we simply
lay these facts before the reader. Let us be cautioned.
