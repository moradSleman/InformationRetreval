Camera Perspective Bias in Videotaped Confessions: Evidence That Visual
Attention Is a Mediator
Lezlee J. Ware, G. Daniel Lassiter, Stephen M. Patterson, and Michael R. Ransom
Ohio University
Several experiments have demonstrated a camera perspective bias in evaluations of videotaped confessions: videotapes with the camera focused on the suspect lead to judgments of greater voluntariness than
alternative presentation formats. The present research investigated potential mediators of this bias. Using
eye tracking to measure visual attention, Experiment 1 replicated the bias and revealed that changes in
camera perspective are accompanied by corresponding changes in duration of fixation on the suspect and
interrogator. A path analysis indicated that visual attention partially mediated the bias, with at least one
additional factor independently contributing to it. A proposed second factor was changes in available
visual content that naturally coincide with alterations in camera perspective. Experiment 2 directly
manipulated observers’ focus and thus more conclusively established visual attention as one mediator of
the camera perspective bias. Together the two experiments provide plausible evidence that differences in
visual content may also mediate the bias.
Keywords: videotaped confessions, camera perspective bias, visual attention, eye tracking

Because the implications of this effect for the criminal justice
system are profound, research is urgently needed to determine the
psychological mechanisms underlying the camera perspective bias
so that empirically based policies can be enacted to ensure that its
impact on American jurisprudence is minimal. In line with this
objective, the present investigations focused on identifying potential mediators of the bias.

Videotaping police interrogations is a growing practice within
the criminal justice system. It is estimated that one third of law
enforcement agencies videotape at least some custodial interrogations (Geller, 1992). An increasing number of states (e.g., Alaska,
Minnesota, and Illinois) have passed legislation or mandated by
judicial decree that all police interrogations, or at least those
associated with serious crimes, be videotaped (National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers [NACDL], 2004; Sullivan &
Thomas, 2003). Proponents of mandated videotaping assert that
having an audio and visual recording of an entire interrogation can
prevent false accusations of police misconduct, decrease the number of detective hours spent in court, and provide a complete
account of what transpired during a suspect’s questioning (Geller,
1992).
Most interrogations are recorded with the camera focused on the
suspect, with little or none of the interrogator(s) visible on videotape (Kassin, 1997). Intuitively, this camera angle appears logical
as presumably the suspect’s behavior will be the most informative
to judges and jurors who will later view the confession. However,
this particular camera angle has been found to produce evaluations
of videotaped confessions that are prejudicial against the suspect,
an effect known as the camera perspective bias (Lassiter, 2002).

The Camera Perspective Bias in Videotaped Confessions
Psychological science has shown that as the visual conspicuousness of a person increases, he or she may be incorrectly
perceived to have a more causal role in an outcome simply because
his or her actions are more salient to observers (Lassiter, Geers,
Munhall, Ploutz-Snyder, & Breitenbecher, 2002; McArthur, 1981;
Taylor & Fiske, 1978). This phenomenon, termed illusory causation (McArthur, 1980), was first documented by Taylor and Fiske
(1975). In their study, seating arrangements were manipulated so
that observers’ visual perspective of a live conversation between
two college students differed. Observers’ subsequent judgments
regarding the amount of causal influence exerted by each student
during the exchange systematically varied with a student’s visual
conspicuousness—the more prominent a student was in observers’
visual field, the more causal or influential he or she was perceived
to be.
Lassiter and Irvine (1986) demonstrated that illusory causation
can similarly affect evaluations of videotaped confessions. Participants viewed one of three videotapes of the same mock interrogation that were different only with respect to the camera’s perspective: a suspect-focus perspective that depicted the front of the
suspect and the back (a shoulder and part of the head) of the
detective, a detective-focus perspective that depicted the front of
the detective and the back (a shoulder and part of the head) of the
suspect, and an equal-focus perspective that depicted profiles of

CAMERA PERSPECTIVE BIAS

both the suspect and detective so that neither was more visually
conspicuous. Participants then made assessments of the voluntariness of the confession. A linear pattern emerged, with judgments
of voluntariness highest for the suspect-focus perspective, lowest
for the detective-focus perspective, and intermediate for the equalfocus perspective.
Since its initial demonstration, the camera perspective bias has
also been found to influence judgments of a suspect’s likelihood of
guilt and sentencing recommendations in the same linear fashion
(Lassiter, Beers, Geers, Handley, Munhall, & Weiland, 2002).
Moreover, numerous investigations attest to the considerable robustness and generalizability of the bias. For example, individual
differences in the motivation to think effortfully (Lassiter, Slaw,
Briggs, & Scanlan, 1992) and in the capacity to reason specifically
about complex causal relationships (Lassiter, Munhall, Berger,
Weiland, Handley, & Geers, 2005) do not moderate the camera
perspective bias, nor is it reduced by situationally increasing
observers’ sense of accountability for their judgments (Lassiter,
Munhall, Geers, Weiland, & Handley, 2001). The bias has also
been shown to occur across various types of crime (Lassiter et al.,
1992), in the context of realistic trial simulations (Lassiter, Geers,
Handley, Weiland, & Munhall, 2002), with samples of college
students and community members from disparate backgrounds
(Lassiter, Geers, Handley et al., 2002), and with authentic videotaped confessions recorded by police that depict actual suspects
and detectives (Lassiter, Ware, Ratcliff, & Irvin, in press). Finally,
relevant expertise does not mitigate the bias as it has been shown
recently to affect the evaluations of highly experienced trial judges
and police interrogators (Lassiter, Diamond, Schmidt, & Elek,
2007; see Lassiter, Geers, Munhall, Handley, & Beers, 2001;
Lassiter & Geers, 2004, and Lassiter, Ratcliff, Ware, & Irvin, 2006
for more extensive reviews of this literature).

Potential Mediators of the Camera Perspective Bias
It has been assumed that the camera perspective bias in videotaped confessions (and illusory causation more generally) is mediated largely by shifts in observers’ visual attention (cf. Lassiter,
Geers et al., 2001; Taylor & Thompson, 1982). That is, whichever
individual—suspect or detective—is more visually conspicuous by
virtue of camera perspective presumably attracts more of the
observers’ attention, which in turn results in biased evaluations. In
the case of an equal-focus videotape, neither the suspect nor the
detective is more visually conspicuous, which should lead to
relatively unbiased evaluations. The latter, in fact, has been confirmed by studies that demonstrate judgments based on equalfocus confessions are comparable to those based on audiotape and
transcript presentations of the confessions (Lassiter et al., 1992;
Lassiter, Beers et al., 2002).
To date, however, there is no direct support for the hypothesis
that visual attention mediates the camera perspective bias. Some
initial data relevant to this point were obtained by Lassiter, Geers,
Munhall et al. (2002, Study 2) who demonstrated that the number
of perceived meaningful behaviors enacted by the suspect and
detective in a videotaped confession varied as a function of the
camera perspective, with observers perceiving more meaningful
behaviors for the more visually salient individual. A follow-up
path (regression) analysis showed that the number of perceived
meaningful actions mediated observers’ subsequent assessments of

193

the confession’s voluntariness. These results, albeit suggestive,
provide inconclusive evidence that visual attention mediates the
camera perspective bias for at least two reasons. First, the process
of perceiving meaningful actions was never directly manipulated,
so there is no definitive proof that it caused the divergent evaluations associated with varying camera perspective. Second, the
measure of this process consisted of participants pressing a button
to indicate when they observed a meaningful action. Such a measure may make use of higher-order conceptual processes in addition to perceptual processes, thereby further diluting the evidence
for attentional mediation.
Ratcliff, Lassiter, Schmidt, and Snyder (2006) later improved
upon this research by having observers view a videotaped confession while simultaneously engaging in either a perceptualinterference task (mentally visualizing a target photograph) or a
conceptual-interference task (mentally rehearsing an eight-digit
number). The former but not the latter task eliminated the camera
perspective bias, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the
bias is perceptual rather than conceptual in nature (cf. Claypool &
Carlston, 2002). However, no direct process measures were included in this investigation, so again the evidence for visual
attention as a mediator of the camera perspective bias remains
incomplete.
Despite the intrinsically compelling nature of a visual-attention
account of the camera perspective bias in evaluations of videotaped confessions and the aforementioned tentative evidence supporting it, there is at least one other plausible mediator that has
been largely overlooked; namely, changes in camera perspective
are accompanied by changes in the visual content available to
observers. As noted earlier, in a suspect-focus videotaped confession the front of the suspect and part of the back of the detective
is visible, whereas the reverse is the case in a detective-focus
videotaped confession. It is possible that this disparity in available
visual content additionally and independently contributes to the
camera perspective bias in evaluations of videotaped confessions.
(A colleague with experience using eye-tracking technology
[M. B. Hallowell, personal communication, April 1, 2005] suggested that another factor potentially influencing evaluations of
videotaped confessions was variability in the amount of time the
suspect and detective actually speak. Although this factor might
indeed affect assessments of voluntariness, it could not truly be a
mediator of the camera perspective bias as speaking times of the
suspect and detective remains constant across different camera
perspectives.) The purpose of the present research, then, was to
provide the first direct test of the long-standing assumption that
visual attention at least partially mediates the camera perspective
bias in videotaped confessions.

Eye Tracking as a Measure of Visual Attention
In the two experiments to be reported, shifts in visual attention
were assessed using eye tracking. The specific technique employed
was electrooculography (EOG; Andreassi, 2000; Stern, Ray, &
Quigley, 2001). As the eyes move, EOG records electrical potential changes by means of electrodes placed on adjacent tissue,
which are then used to determine the direction and duration of an
observer’s eye fixations (Andreassi, 2000; Stern et al., 2001).
In eye-tracking studies, a distinction is made between saccades
and fixations. Saccadic eye movements serve a searching or

scanning function, occur very quickly, and take in virtually no
pattern information. Fixations, on the other hand, occur when the
eyes align with a specific object so that its image falls on the fovea.
Therefore, only when fixations are achieved is useful information
being registered by observers (Andreassi, 2000; Henderson &
Ferreira, 2004).
Eye fixations are not randomly distributed. While viewing a
scene, an observer will tend to have fixation clusters around an
informative portion, which often includes objects relevant to scene
identification and the faces of targets (Gullberg, 2003). The duration of these fixations allow the amount of visual attention paid to
a specific area or target within a scene to be determined (Gullberg,
2003; Henderson & Ferreira, 2004; Isaacowitz, 2005). Although
eye fixations can be dissociated from visual attention in certain
instances, psychophysical evidence suggests that the two are related under normal circumstances (cf. Parkhurst, Law, & Niebur,
2002). Moreover, EOG is considered a reliable and valid method
of recording eye fixations for the purpose of gauging visual attention (Andreassi, 2000).
Eye-tracking techniques, such as EOG, have been used to investigate attentional processes in a variety of psychological research (e.g., Recarte & Nunes, 2000). They have been instrumental
in demonstrating that optimistic individuals avoid looking directly
at emotionally arousing negative stimuli (Isaacowitz, 2005, 2006),
in establishing where attention is directed within text and pictures
in advertisements (Rayner, Rotello, Stewart, Keir, & Duffy, 2001),
and in revealing that highly anxious individuals manifest different
patterns of attention to threatening facial expressions than their
nonanxious counterparts (Mogg, Millar, & Bradley, 2000). As a
whole, this literature indicates that tracking eye fixations should
enable a strong test of whether visual attention is a plausible
mediator of the camera perspective bias in videotaped confessions.

Experiment 1
In the first experiment, camera perspective was varied to create
a suspect-focus version and a detective-focus version of a simulated videotaped confession. While viewing one of these videotapes, participants were connected to EOG equipment so that their
visual attention could be continuously monitored and recorded.
Following the videotape presentation, participants were asked to
provide an assessment of the extent to which they judged the
confession to be voluntary. We expected to find, consistent with
past research, that participants viewing the suspect-focus videotape
would judge the confession to be more voluntary than participants
viewing the detective-focus videotape. We also predicted that
camera perspective would influence visual attention, such that
greater attention would be directed toward the individual who was
facing the camera and therefore was the most salient. Finally, path
(regression) analyses were conducted to test the specific prediction
that visual attention at least partially mediates the camera perspective bias. If visual attention solely mediates the bias, once its
influence is partialed out, no significant direct (unmediated) effect
of camera perspective on voluntariness judgments should remain.
However, if a significant direct (unmediated) effect of camera
perspective still remains after removing the variance associated
with visual attention, it would suggest that one or more unmeasured factors (e.g., visual content) additionally contribute to the
bias in voluntariness judgments.

Method
Participants. Seventy-five Ohio University undergraduates
(37 females, 38 males) individually took part in the study as a
means of partially satisfying a course requirement or garnering
extra credit in an introductory psychology class. (An additional 25
participants could not be used either because they recognized the
person playing the detective in the videotape [n ⫽ 2] or because at
least one electrode necessary for obtaining eye-fixation data detached during the course of the experiment. We believe that higher
than ideal humidity in the rooms used for the research exacerbated
the extent of the latter problem. It should be noted that participant
attrition was comparable across conditions.)
Videotaped confession. A 268-s portion of a videotaped simulation of the interrogation and confession of Bradley Page used in
prior camera perspective studies (e.g., Lassiter, Geers, Handley et
al., 2002) was extracted and served as the primary stimulus. The
simulation was originally created from transcripts of the real
interrogation and therefore depicts actual behaviors enacted by the
true suspect and detective. Two versions of the videotape were
used: the suspect-focus version showed the front of the suspect and
a portion of the detective’s back (see Figure 1), whereas the
detective-focus version showed the front of the detective and a
portion of the suspect’s back (see Figure 2).
EOG set up and calibration. The simulated videotaped confession was presented to participants on a 17-in monitor and
computer connected to a BIOPAC MP100 unit (Biopac Systems,
Santa Barbara, CA) set up to track eye movements. Participants
were properly positioned on a chin rest that kept the head approximately 33 cm from the center of the nose to the center of the
viewing monitor. Throughout the videotape presentation, continuous horizontal and vertical readings were recorded from four
4-mm shielded well electrodes placed so that drawing a straight
line between the pair of vertical electrodes and the pair of horizontal electrodes would bisect the participants’ pupil. Horizontal
electrodes were approximately placed on the right and left temple
regions. Both vertical and horizontal ground electrodes (silversilver chloride, unshielded electrodes, 4 mm in diameter) were
placed on the center of the forehead. All electrode locations were
cleaned before placement with alcohol pads to remove excess oils.
Electrodes were attached using double-sided adhesive electrode
collars and filled with pH-balanced electrode gel to enhance conductivity.
EOG data were recorded using Acqknowledge 3.7.1 software
(Biopac Systems). The BIOPAC MP100 was connected to MEC
100 amplifiers, one for horizontal eye movements and one for
vertical eye movements. Eye movements were sampled at a rate of
1,000 per second and were collected in millivolt.
Before viewing the videotaped confession, each participant’s
eye movements were calibrated to the EOG equipment. Calibration
consisted of the presentation of a 120-s video of a black dot
moving at measured intervals around the edge of the screen. The
dot began in the center of the screen, where it remained for 10
seconds. It then advanced to the center and top of the screen before
traversing the outermost perimeter at nine designated positions,
starting at the upper right corner and ending in the upper left
corner. The dot remained at each designated point for a 5-s interval
before returning to the center of the screen for an additional 30
seconds. Participants were instructed to look at the dot throughout

the calibration procedure, which recorded the baseline for each
location for each participant. Baseline measures were later used to
identify the location of each participant’s eye fixations during
observation of the videotaped confession.
Procedure. Upon their arrival, participants were told that part
of the experiment involved monitoring their eye movements while
they viewed a videotape, and that this would require a series of
electrodes be placed on their heads. After the experimenter prepared and placed electrodes on participants, they were asked to
assume the role of jurors to assist researchers in discovering how
decisions about the voluntariness of videotaped confessions are
made. To help participants understand their task, a brief description of the concept of coercion derived from a judicial instruction
manual (Mathes & DeVitt, 1965) was read to them. They were
informed that “during an interrogation the detective is bound by
law to avoid coercing the suspect into confessing. . . for example,
the detective may not threaten the suspect physically or use verbal
threats.” The experimenter made sure that participants understood
all instructions before continuing.
All florescent lights were extinguished to reduce electrical interference, and a desk lamp positioned on the desk behind and to
the right of the computer monitor was turned on to provide less
disruptive lighting. Once calibration of the EOG equipment was
completed (see above), participants were randomly shown either
the suspect-focus or detective-focus videotaped confession. After
the videotape presentation, electrodes were removed and the participants were escorted to a second computer on which they
responded to a series of questions designed to assess the degree to
which they judged the confession to be voluntary.
The first question asked participants to indicate whether the
“suspect’s confession was. . .” forced out of the suspect by the
detective (1) or given freely by the suspect (9); the second asked
them to indicate “how the suspect’s confession was obtained?”
(1 ⫽ the confession was coerced, 9 ⫽ the confession was given
voluntarily); and the third asked them to indicate the degree to
which they believed “the detective tricked the suspect into confessing” (1 ⫽ to a large degree, 9 ⫽ not at all). Each of these
measures has been used successfully in previous investigations of
the camera perspective bias (cf. Lassiter, Geers et al., 2001).
Additional questionnaire items not directly related to the voluntary
status of the confession included ones assessing perceptions of the
detective’s empathy toward the suspect, the suspect’s nervousness,
and the likeability of both individuals (all on 9-point scales). These
items were exploratory and therefore will not be discussed further.
After making their responses, participants were debriefed, thanked
for their participation, and dismissed.

Visual attention. Eye fixations that fell on the left half of the
video image were considered to be directed at the suspect and
those that fell on the right half of the image were considered to be
directed at the detective (see Figures 1 and 2); however, each
participant’s specific calibration data were used to refine fixation
location on an individual basis. Duration of eye fixations (in
seconds) was then calculated separately for the suspect and detective.
These data were submitted to a 2 (camera perspective: suspect
focus vs. detective focus) ⫻ 2 (fixation target: suspect vs. detective) ANOVA, with the first variable being a between-subjects
factor and the second a within-subjects factor. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of fixation target such that participants spent more time attending to the suspect (M ⫽ 135.15,
SD ⫽ 59.61) than to the detective (M ⫽ 115.54, SD ⫽ 60.99), F(1,

by the predicted interaction of fixation target and camera perspective, F(1, 72) ⫽ 45.23, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ 1.59 (see Table 1 for cell
means and standard deviations). Simple-effects tests established
that when viewing the suspect-focus videotape, participants attended significantly longer to the suspect than to the detective,

detective-focus videotape, they attended significantly longer to the
detective than to the suspect, t(72) ⫽ 9.56, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ 2.25.
Our colleague mentioned previously thought that it was possible
that time spent talking would qualify the effect of camera perspective on visual attention. To assess this possibility we first determined the durations of fixation on the suspect and detective when
they were talking and when they were not talking. These values
were entered into a 2 (camera perspective) ⫻ 2 (talking) ⫻ 2 (not
talking) ANOVA, with the latter two factors being within subjects.
The ANOVA revealed a significant interaction of camera perspective with both the talking and not-talking factors ( ps ⬍ .001).

Voluntariness judgments. Following procedures established in

judged to be more voluntary. Replicating past findings on the

individual (by virtue of camera perspective) drew greater visual
attention. The lack of a significant three-way interaction ( p ⬎ .12)
further indicated that whether the suspect or detective was talking
or not talking did not qualify the effect of camera perspective on
visual attention.
Mediation analysis. A path analysis was conducted to determine if visual attention mediated, at least in part, the effect of
camera perspective on voluntariness judgments. First, a single
index of visual attention was created by subtracting the duration of
fixations on the detective from the duration of fixations on the
suspect. Then, in accordance with Kenny, Kashy and Bolger
(1998), path coefficients (standardized beta weights) were estimated using regression analyses. As shown in Figure 3, the paths
from camera perspective to visual attention and from visual attention to voluntariness index were both significant. The direct path
from camera perspective to voluntariness index (after partialing
out the effect of visual attention) remained significant. A Sobel test
(cf. Kenny et al., 1998) revealed that inclusion of visual attention
in the model produced a significant reduction in the variance
accounted for by the camera-perspective manipulation, Z ⫽ 1.80,
p ⬍ .05, one-tailed. Overall, then, the path analysis confirms that
visual attention acts as a mediator of the camera perspective bias;
however, at least one other (unmeasured) factor contributing significant variance is also implicated.

Discussion
With the aid of eye tracking, Experiment 1 provides good
evidence that visual attention at least partially mediates the camera

perspective bias. There are, however, limitations of this study that
must be acknowledged. First, and most critical, Experiment 1 did
not manipulate observers’ visual attention; instead visual attention
was allowed to vary freely to establish that it was related to
changes in camera perspective as well as to voluntariness judgments. These correlational data, though, do not demonstrate conclusively that shifts in visual attention truly cause voluntariness
judgments to change in the predicted manner.
A second issue with Experiment 1 is that it provides insufficient
insight into the nature of the (at least one) additional mediator of
the camera perspective bias that was indicated by the path analysis.
As discussed earlier, a previously uninvestigated factor possibly
contributing to the biased voluntariness judgments observed in the
first experiment is the change in available visual content naturally
coinciding with the camera-perspective manipulation. Although a
plausible hypothesis, the findings from Experiment 1 alone cannot
substantiate it.
Finally, as noted earlier, equal-focus videotaped confessions
produce voluntariness judgments that do not differ significantly
from those produced by corresponding audiotape and transcript
versions of the confessions (Lassiter et al., 1992; Lassiter, Beers et
al., 2002), a finding that suggests no bias is associated with a
camera perspective that makes neither the suspect nor the detective
relatively more conspicuous. If differential salience is indeed what
caused visual attention to vary in Experiment 1, then there is no
reason to expect that visual attention will significantly favor the
suspect or the detective when neither is more visually conspicuous
than the other, as is the case in equal-focus videotaped confessions.
As this particular camera perspective was not included in Experiment 1, these potentially informative data were not obtained.

Experiment 2
A second experiment was designed to address each of the
aforementioned limitations. All participants viewed an equal-focus
videotape of a simulated interrogation dealing with sexual assault.
The visual attention of participants was directly manipulated
through verbal instruction. Participants were instructed to attend
the suspect, detective, or both, or they were given no focus
instruction (control). We anticipated that these instructions would
determine where in the videotape participants directed their visual
attention as measured once again by EOG: attend-to-suspect instruction should lead participants to fixate longer on the suspect,
attend-to-detective instruction should lead participants to fixate
longer on the detective, and attend-to-both and no instructions
should lead participants to fixate on the suspect and detective for
comparable durations. An absence of any difference in fixation

duration in the no-instruction condition would add further weight
to the argument that differential conspicuousness is an important
trigger of divergence in visual attention during the observation of
videotaped confessions.
As the manipulation of instruction is a substitute for manipulation of camera perspective, we would expect it to yield a linear
pattern in voluntariness judgments similar to that found in many
previous investigations of the camera perspective bias. That is,
attend-to-suspect instruction should lead participants to judge the
confession as more voluntary than attend-to-both and no instructions, which in turn should lead participants to judge the confession as more voluntary than attend-to-detective instruction.
Finally, we anticipated that a path analysis would show that
visual attention was the only significant mediator of the effect of
focus instruction on voluntariness. As visual content was held
constant across all conditions, such a result would provide additional support for the hypothesis that differences in available visual
content can contribute to the camera perspective bias.

Method
Participants. Seventy-eight introductory psychology students
from Ohio University (57 females, 21 males) participated individually in exchange for partial course credit. (High humidity was
once again a problem, with data from 33 additional participants
lost because of electrodes detaching before completion of a session. As was true in the first experiment, the distribution of
attrition was roughly equivalent across conditions.)
Videotaped confession. A 213-s videotape of a simulated interrogation and confession to a sexual assault used recently to
demonstrate that judges and law enforcement officers also manifest the camera perspective bias (Lassiter, Diamond et al., 2007)
served as the primary stimulus. Unlike the aforementioned research, however, only the equal-focus version of the confession
was included in the present investigation. The camera perspective
was such that the suspect and detective were each seen in profile,
with the detective on the far left of the screen and the suspect on
the far right (see Figure 4). This simulation was not based on a
particular authentic interrogation and confession, but instead was
designed to be a composite of various elements that have been
documented to occur in real interrogations or that are recommended by interrogation-training manuals.
EOG set up and calibration. All eye-tracking procedures and
equipment were the same as those employed in Experiment 1.
Procedure. Before calibrating the equipment, the experimenter randomly assigned participants to one of four focusinstruction conditions: In the attend-to-suspect condition, participants were instructed to “pay special attention to the suspect”; in
the attend-to-detective condition, they were instructed to “pay
special attention to the detective”; and in the attend-to-both condition, they were instructed to “pay attention to both the detective
and the suspect.” Participants in the no-instruction (control) condition were told nothing regarding where to direct their attention
while viewing the videotaped confession. The remainder of the
procedure was identical to that of Experiment 1.

Voluntariness judgments. The voluntariness index was submitted to a one-way ANOVA, with focus instruction as the inde-

197

pendent variable. The predicted linear trend was obtained, Flinear
(1, 74) ⫽ 7.37, p ⬍ .01, d ⫽ .63. Participants instructed to attend
the suspect judged the confession to be the most voluntary (M ⫽
5.93, SD ⫽ 1.52), participants instructed to attend the detective
judged it to be the least voluntary (M ⫽ 4.50, SD ⫽ 1.47), and
participants instructed to attend both (M ⫽ 4.73, SD ⫽ 1.95) or
given no instruction (M ⫽ 4.82, SD ⫽ 1.75) judged it to be
moderately voluntary.
Visual attention. Eye fixations that fell on the left half of the
video image were considered to be directed at the detective and
those that fell on the right half of the image were considered to be
directed at the suspect (see Figure 4); however, as in Experiment
1, individual refinement of fixation location was accomplished
using participants’ specific calibration data. As before, duration of
eye fixations (in seconds) was calculated separately for the suspect
and detective.
These data were then submitted to a 4 (focus instruction: attend
to suspect vs. attend to detective vs. attend to both vs. no instruction) ⫻ 2 (fixation target: suspect vs. detective) between–within
ANOVA. The analysis revealed only a significant two-way interaction, F(3, 74) ⫽ 4.94, p ⬍ .01, ␩p2 ⫽ .17. Examination of the
means (see Table 2) indicated that instructions to focus on the
suspect led participants to visually attend more to the suspect and
less to the detective, whereas instructions to focus on the detective
led participants to visually attend more to the detective and less to
the suspect. Instructions to focus on both the suspect and detective
and no instruction led participants to allocate their attention
equally between the fixation targets. Linear contrasts performed on
duration of fixation on the suspect, Flinear (1, 74) ⫽ 6.69, p ⬍ .05,
d ⫽ .60, and on duration of fixation on the detective, Flinear (1,
74) ⫽ 13.42, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ .85, were both significant.
Mediation analysis. A path analysis was conducted to determine if visual attention mediated, at least in part, the effect of
focus instruction on voluntariness judgments. As in Experiment 1,
path coefficients (standardized beta weights) were estimated using
regression analyses. As shown in Figure 5, the paths from focus

instruction to visual attention and from visual attention to voluntariness index were both significant. Importantly, the direct path
from focus instruction to voluntariness index (after partialing out
the effect of visual attention) was no longer significant. A Sobel
test further demonstrated that inclusion of visual attention in the
model produced a significant reduction in the variance accounted
for by the focus-instruction manipulation, Z ⫽ 1.99, p ⬍ .05.
Overall, then, the path analysis indicates that visual attention fully
mediated the effect of focus instruction on voluntariness judgments (cf. Kenny et al., 1998).

Discussion
Experiment 2 improved upon and complemented the first investigation in several ways. First, the direct manipulation of focus via
verbal instruction demonstrated more definitively that shifts in
visual attention cause corresponding changes in voluntariness
judgments. This effect of focus instruction on voluntariness judgments cannot be dismissed as simply resulting from demand characteristics because the path analysis revealed that the influence of
instruction on judgments was indirect, that is, fully mediated by
participants’ actual visual attention. Second, the inclusion of a
no-instruction/control condition and an equal-focus videotaped
confession established that observers are inclined to divide their
visual attention equally between the suspect and detective when
neither is more visually conspicuous than the other, thereby further
strengthening the argument that the camera perspective bias arises
when conditions of differential salience are created. Third, the use
of an equal-focus videotape also yielded additional support for the
hypothesis that available visual content is a second factor that
contributes to the camera perspective bias in videotaped confessions. That is, in contrast to Experiment 1, the equal-focus camera
perspective held visual content constant, and under this circumstance the path analysis indicated that visual attention was the sole
mediator of voluntariness judgments.
Although the evidence for visual content as a mediator is less
direct than the evidence for visual attention, we believe that the
findings of Experiments 1 and 2 together provide at least tentative
support for the argument that visual content does contribute to the
camera perspective bias in evaluations of videotaped confessions.
Below we discuss in greater detail exactly how changes in available visual content might lead to alterations in voluntariness judgments above and beyond what is attributable to visual attention.

camera perspective bias in videotape confessions and, by extension, other instances of illusory causation that are based on asymmetries in visual salience. Previous investigations have supported
a visual-attention account of the camera perspective bias (Lassiter,
Geers, Munhall et al., 2002, Study 2; Ratcliff et al., 2006), but
these studies were incomplete in that visual attention was not
experimentally manipulated, or they used indirect measures of
attentional processing, or did not include processing measures at
all. The present two experiments advance the prior literature by
using eye tracking to assess visual attention and by manipulating
focus directly, in addition to allowing it to vary naturally with
changes in camera perspective.
As a whole the results of these experiments provide the strongest evidence to date that visual attention is indeed a mediator of
the camera perspective bias. The data from Experiment 1, however, indicate that visual attention alone does not account for the
entire effect of camera perspective on voluntariness judgments.
Because changes in camera perspective also lead to corresponding
changes in the visual content observers can feasibly apprehend, we
proffered that available visual content could be a second factor
contributing to the divergence in voluntariness judgments found in
the first experiment. The fact that holding visual content constant
in Experiment 2 rendered visual attention the sole mediator of
voluntariness judgments lends credence to this hypothesis.

How Visual Content Might Independently Contribute to
the Camera Perspective Bias
A recent study by Schmidt and Lassiter (2007) sheds some light
on the manner through which availability of visual content, independent of visual attention, may contribute to the camera perspective bias. These researchers investigated observers’ ability to detect the most explicit and legally impermissible tactic in the
interrogator’s arsenal—a direct threat—as a function of
confession-presentation format. Two simulated interrogations
dealing with a hit-and-run accident based on materials used initially by Kassin and McNall (1991) were developed. In the first of
these, the interrogator at one point issues a very strong and direct
threat to elicit an admission of guilt from the suspect and in the
other this tactic is omitted. Aside from this difference, the two
versions of the interrogation, which ended with the suspect confessing, were identical. The two versions of the interrogation were
each videotaped from a suspect-focus and detective-focus camera
perspective. Observers viewed one of the two interrogations (threat
vs. no threat) in one of the two presentation formats (suspect focus
vs. detective focus) and subsequently rendered a verdict of guilty
or not guilty.
Analysis of the verdict data indicated significant main effects of
camera perspective and presence/absence of threat: conviction rate
was higher in the suspect-focus videotape and for the interrogation

General Discussion
The primary goal of this research was to conduct a rigorous
evaluation of the assumption that visual attention mediates the

CAMERA PERSPECTIVE BIAS

without the threat. Most relevant to the present discussion, there
was also a significant interaction indicating that the effect of
camera perspective was greater in the threat condition than in the
no-threat condition— conviction rates were 100%, 70%, 78%, and
33% in the suspect-focus/no-threat, detective-focus/no-threat, suspect-focus/threat, and detective-focus/threat cells, respectively. Visual attention by itself cannot seemingly account for the interaction
as it is unclear why visual attention would greatly diverge between
the threat and no threat conditions. (The threat was the only
differences between the two interrogations and it took up only 10
seconds of an approximately 300 second long videotape.) Disparity in available visual content because of camera point of view,
however, may provide an explanation.
Although the verbal aspects of the threat were clearly the same
for participants in both camera-perspective formats, the facial
expressions that accompanied it were only visible to observers
viewing the detective-focus videotape. Thus, a possible reason
why the effect of camera perspective was greater in the threat
condition is that when evaluating the reliability of the confession,
observers based their assessments not just on verbal content—for
example, did the interrogator say something threatening?— but
also on corresponding visual content—for example, did the interrogator look truly menacing while saying it? When access to the
latter source of information was precluded by camera perspective,
observers may have felt they had insufficient evidence to assess a
suspect’s admission statements as unreliable and thus decided it
was prudent to convict.
Admittedly, such an account is largely speculative at this stage.
Nonetheless, the present research along with the findings of
Schmidt and Lassiter (2007) suggest that the extent to which, and
by what manner, availability of visual content might influence
evaluations of videotaped confessions is a topic worthy of further
investigation.

Implications of an Overdetermined Camera Perspective
Bias
The current findings indicate that the camera perspective bias in
videotaped confession is produced by more than one factor. This
overdetermination of the bias suggests that it would not be a
simple task to completely eliminate the bias, as any particular
strategy for undermining it would have to target more than one
cause. This may explain, in part, why various straightforward
attempts at attenuating the bias have been unsuccessful (cf.
Lassiter et al., 2006).
For example, on two separate occasions attempts at mitigating
the camera perspective bias by explicitly forewarning observers of
its existence did not significantly reduce the bias (Lassiter, Beers
et al., 2002; Lassiter, Geers, Handley et al., 2002). The content of
the forewarning consisted of the following:
Because the confession was videotaped, you should be aware that
your judgments could be affected by the angle of the camera. In
thinking about the videotape, you should focus on what the detective
and defendant actually said and how they behaved. Do not allow the
angle of the camera to influence your decision about whether the
confession was voluntary or coerced.

Even if this instruction were effective in causing observers to
distribute their attention more equally between the suspect and

199

detective (note the similarity to the attend-to-both instruction in
Experiment 2), the forewarning would have had no impact on
differences in availability of visual content unavoidably created by
the manipulation of camera perspective. Thus, the present research
suggests that prior attempts at undoing the prejudicial influence of
camera perspective by explicitly forewarning observers of its existence may have actually corrected one mediator of the bias—
namely, visual attention— but not eradicated the bias because it
was maintained by an unrelated, second mediator—possibly, availability of visual content.

Policy Implications
Knowing with greater certainty that the camera perspective bias
is mediated by visual attention and at least one other factor is of
considerable practical value. As Lassiter, Geers et al. (2001) argued, the prejudicial effect of camera perspective can be viewed as
a particularly pernicious form of mental contamination (cf. Wilson
& Brekke, 1994), one that cannot be easily undone after the fact.
The present findings indicating that the camera perspective bias is
overdetermined add further weight to this assertion. Moreover, our
results strongly point to the strategy of exposure control as a means
of combating the bias. That is, it seems the surest way to prevent
the camera perspective bias from happening is to implement a
policy that would preclude the possibility of judges or jurors ever
seeing a videotaped confession that focused exclusively on the
suspect. Instead, admissible videotaped confessions would be
those that permitted observers to view both the suspect and interrogator(s) equally, for that would eliminate the differential conspicuousness and the disparity in available visual content that
appear to be the mediators of the bias associated with suspectfocus videotapes.
Ideally, policy could be enacted at the level of law enforcement,
mandating that criminal interrogations be recorded from the outset
from an equal-focus perspective. This very practice has been
adopted in New Zealand, and in light of the current data, it is even
clearer that such an approach is the best remedy currently available
for keeping the camera perspective bias (illusory causation) out of
the courtroom.
