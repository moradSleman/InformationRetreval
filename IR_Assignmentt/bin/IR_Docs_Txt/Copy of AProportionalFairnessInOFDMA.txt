QoS Provision in Downlink OFDMA Systems
Tien-Dzung Nguyen and Youngnam Han, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract— In this letter, we formulate a downlink packet
scheduling problem for proportional fairness in orthogonal frequency division multiple access with frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) systems to derive necessary conditions for optimality, which results in efficient subcarrier and power allocation
algorithms. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm
achieves the tradeoff between system throughput and fairness.
Index Terms— OFDMA, proportional fairness, channel allocation, power allocation, scheduling.

allocated power of user k to subcarrier n. Assume that MQAM modulation is applied with a BER requirement, then
|Hk,n |2
the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is gk,n = Nk,n
Γ , where Γ =
−ln(5BER)/1.5 [4]. The capacity of user k on subcarrier n is
normalized by rk,n = ln(1 + pk,n gk,n ). An indicator variable
is defined as follows: wk,n = 1 if subcarrier n is allocated to
user k, and wk,n = 0, otherwise. Instantaneous data rate of
user k can be written as

ACKET scheduling has been one of the most important
issues in the context of radio resource management,
where proportional fairness (PF) scheduling is considered
to achieve tradeoff between system throughput and fairness,
i.e., decrease in system throughput while improving fairness
among users and vice versa[1], [2]. It is known that a PF
problem is NP-hard which requires high complexity. Cooperative game theoretic approach was taken in [2] to solve
PF problem in uplink OFDMA systems. In downlink case,
however, previous works are mostly heuristics derived from a
PF scheduling adopted for single carrier systems such as high
data rate (HDR) [3]. In [1], they extended and derived the
PF scheduling for multi-carrier systems, without providing an
efficient subcarrier and power allocation algorithm.
In this letter, we formulate an optimal PF problem as the
maximization of the sum of logarithmic user data rate in
downlink OFDMA systems with constraints on total transmit
power and user data rate. Using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions for optimality [7], we propose an efficient subcarrier and power allocation algorithm based on water filling
method for the set of subcarriers allocated to each user. It
should be mentioned that the same analysis can be applied to
the PF problem formulated as maximization of the sum of the
logarithmic function of user average data rate.

where w = [wk,n ]K×N , p = [pk,n ]K×N , PT is the total
transmit power and Rkmin is the minimum required data rate
of user k. And it is assumed that there are N subcarriers and
K users in the network. Note that P F (w, p) is neither convex
nor concave with respect to (w, p). Although wk,n takes the
value of either 0 or 1, it can be relaxed to a real number in
[0,1] to make the problem tractable.
B. Optimality Conditions
Considering PF problem with no data rate constraint (6),
we have the following proposition.

From Eqs. (10) and (12), we have two cases: (1) if subcarrier
n is not allocated to user k (wk,n = 0), then rk,n = 0 and
rk,n /Rk − µn ≤ 0 and (2) if subcarrier n is allocated to user
k (wk,n > 0), then rk,n > 0 and rk,n /Rk − µn = 0. This
implies that subcarrier n should be allocated to user k ∗ by
Eq. (7).
Similarly, from Eqs. (11) and (13), power allocated on
subcarrier n to user k ∗ is
wk∗ ,n gk∗ ,n
− λ = 0.
(14)
Rk∗ (1 + pk∗ ,n gk∗ ,n )
Following the same implication as in [5], we conclude that
the problem (2) always has an optimal solution where wk,n ’s
are binary. Thus, wk∗ ,n = 1 and from Eq. (14),

Notice that pk,n ≥ 0, implies Eq. (8).
III. P ROPOSED A LGORITHM
Firstly, we propose a subcarrier allocation algorithm based
on Eq. (7). Then, a power allocation algorithm is determined
by Eq. (8). And finally, a joint subcarrier and power allocation
algorithm is presented to reduce computational complexity.
Subcarrier Allocation: To make Eq. (7) tractable, we assume that equal power is distributed to all subcarriers, i.e.
pk,n = PT /N for all k and n. At a decision epoch t, if
subcarrier n is assigned to user k, then user k’s data rate
is updated by
Rk (t) = Rk (t − 1) + rk,n ,

(16)

where Rk (t − 1) is user k’s data rate at (t − 1). The right hand
side of Eq. (7) becomes
∆

uk,n (t) =

rk,n
rk,n
=
, ∀k, ∀n,
Rk (t)
Rk (t − 1) + rk,n

(17)

which is an increasing function of rk,n . This implies that
subcarrier n prefers to be assigned to user k ∗ whose SNR
on this channel is the best. However, Rk∗ will be larger and
at the next decision epoch (t + 1), for any n = n,
uk∗ ,n (t + 1) =

rk∗ ,n

(18)

will be decreasing. As a result, once user k ∗ has been
selected, his chance of selecting other subcarriers n (= n)
will be decreased, or other users have higher priorities to
select subcarriers. Therefore, both throughput and fairness are
enhanced.
The subcarrier allocation algorithm is divided into two
steps:
Step 1 : Assign the smallest number of subcarriers to each
user to guarantee the minimum required rate.
Step 2 : The rest of subcarriers are assigned further to
users in the first step by Eq. (7), where Rk can be
calculated recursively by Eq. (16).
Power Allocation: Assume that Sk is the set of subcarriers
allocated to user k. From (8), power allocation to user k on
subcarriers in Sk is by water filling with total transmit power
Pk = |Sk |PT /N , where |Sk | is the cardinality of Sk .
Since λ
k = pk,n + 1/gk,n , ∀n ∈ Sk , we



.
⇒ λk = |S1k | Pk + n∈Sk gk,n
Substituting λk into Eq. (8),we can calculate pk,n .
Joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is then
elaborately presented as follows;
1. Initialize: Sk = ∅, Rk = 0, λk = 0 ∀k.

IV. P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION
We compared our proposed algorithm with following algorithms: (1) water filling (WF) algorithm proposed in [5] which
provides near optimal system throughput; and (2) max-min
algorithm proposed in [6] which provides nearly full system
fairness.

Shadowing is assumed to be lognormally distributed with
mean 0 dB and standard deviation 8 dB. Other parameters
to be mentioned are: BER of 10−4 , minimum required rate
of 2[Mbps], modulation constellation of QPSK, system bandwidth of 10[MHz] the number of subcarriers of 512, carrier
frequency of 1.9 [GHz], total transmit power of BS 10[W]
and noise power of -100[dB].
B. Simulation Results

Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 shows the performance of system fairness with
respect to the number of users. In this figure, FI of maxmin algorithm is almost 1 for all cases, which means that this
algorithm achieves nearly a perfect fairness. On the contrary,
water filling algorithm provides the lowest fairness. Although
the fairness of our proposed algorithm is lower than that of
max-min optimization, it is much higher than that of water
filling, especially when the system is heavily loaded.
In Fig. 2, system throughput is shown with respect to the
number of users. The throughput of our proposed algorithm
is slightly degraded comparing with maximum throughput
algorithm and significantly enhanced over max-min algorithm.
Therefore it can be said that the proposed algorithm provides
a good tradeoff for system throughput and fairness.

where xk is the resource portion allocated to user k. In this
paper, we define xk = Rk − Rkmin which is a surplus rate to
user k. If all users get the same surplus rate, then xk ’s are
all equal to let FI be 1, and the system is 100% fair. As the
disparity increases, the FI decreases to 0.
A. Simulation Environment and Parameters
Consider a single cell (BS) with the radius of 1km. We
generate two classes of users by dividing the cell into two
zones: inner zone (0 < d ≤ 0.5km) and outer zone (0.5 <
d ≤ 1km), where d is the distance from the center to a
user. And the number of users are equally divided into each
zone, i.e., 50% of the total users. Users are assumed to be
uniformly distributed in each zone. The COST 231 Hata urban

In this letter, we formulate a PF optimization problem
as a maximization of the sum of logarithmic user data rate
in downlink OFDMA systems. From necessary conditions
on optimality obtained analytically by KKT condition, we
propose an efficient subcarrier and power allocation algorithm
based on water filling. It is shown through simulation that
our proposed algorithm is slightly degraded in throughput and
provides improved fairness comparing with the best schemes
in throughput and perfect fairness, especially when there are
large number of users.
