Abstract - With the rapid growth in Data Center Network

reduce the load on the transport protocol. With
advancement in the Ethernet link to 10 GBPS, there is
improvement in bandwidth usage consequently.

(DCN), many problems are observed by the researchers. These
problems are related to its architecture, congestion control
and TCP throughput. Nowadays, there is vast improvement in
the Data Center Network with respect to Congestion
Notification. In today’s scenario Data Center Ethernet (DCE) is
mostly used as compared to other technologies. Ethernet is low
in cost and primary protocol used in DCN. But this Ethernet
technology may also lead to packet drop and low bandwidth
utilization, consequently lead to congestion. To solve this
problem various Ethernet protocols are being developed to
prevent congestion at the switch such as Backward Congestion
Control (BCN), Enhanced Forward Explicit Congestion
Notification (E-FECN), Forward Explicit Congestion
Notification (FECN), Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN),
Approximate Fair Quantized Congestion Notification (AFQCN) and Fair Quantized Congestion Notification (FQCN).
Among those algorithms QCN is ratified as the formal
standard. In this paper, we are going to cover all the aspects of
recent research activities in DCNs, in terms of network
congestion notification algorithms. We present a brief
overview of the congestion problem along with previously
proposed solutions.

This Survey paper will mostly going to focus on solutions
provided by various algorithms.
This paper is organized as follows: We describe Congestion
Control mechanisms with Congestion Notification algorithms
in section 2. In section 3 we compares different congestion
notification algorithms proposed for DCNs and finally
conclude in Section 4.

2. CONGESTION CONTROL IN DATA CENTERS
Due to features like ease of use and low in cost Ethernet
become most popular network protocol for communication
in data center network. There are many other protocol
developed by, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [4]
and the IEEE Data Center Bridging Task Group of IEEE 802.1
Working Group [5]. Transport protocol, such as TCP is
responsible for reliable transmissions in IP networks. So
there is need for managing and controlling the reliability in
transmission with the help of Congestion Notification
algorithm. Thus, one area of the Ethernet extensions that can
enhanced the performance of transport protocol without
penalizing the throughput is Congestion Notification [6].

Key Words: Quantized Congestion Notification, Data
Centre Network, Congestion Control.

1. INTRODUCTION

Congestion notification is a data link layer traffic
management protocol that in initial stage, monitors the
status of queues and then pushes the congestion at the edge
of the network. At the edge of the network, rate limiters are
works, which handles traffic to avoid frame losses at the
Ethernet Switch [8]. Detecting and generating feedback is
done at the switch and controlling is done at the source
itself. Switch sends the congestion message to the source
based on the calculated congestion measure. Rate regulators
at the sources will adjust the rate of individual flows
according to congestion feedback messages received from
switches. In this survey paper, we are going to study and
compare the congestion notification algorithms proposed for
the Ethernet extensions in data centers. Project IEEE
802.Qau is one of the research standard that concerned with
specifications of an Ethernet Layer or Layer 2 congestion
notification mechanism for DCNs basically belongs to IEEE
Data Center Bridging Task Group. Several congestion

Data center plays an important role in storing, accessing,
processing data and consist of a large number of storage
devices [1]. Along with storage devices, Data Center
Networks has its servers to manage the data and the
Ethernet switches for connectivity between those devices.
Data center network is used in various sectors including
government, business, education and financial sector [2].
Data Center Network is expanding with an exponential rate
and with this development there observed many problems
such as congestion, packet loss and TCP Incast [1].
Traditionally, TCP protocol is the only protocol that ensure
the reliable transmission at the transport layer [3] while
other protocol such as UDP does not have that facility. So the
advancement in Ethernet protocol can overcome the
penalizing effect on transport layer protocol. Therefore,
congestion notification technique comes into the picture to

notification algorithms have been proposed, e.g., BCN [6],
FECN [8], enhanced FECN (E-FECN) [9], QCN [10], AF-QCN
[11] and FQCN [12]. Congestion notification algorithms with
their system models are shown in below figures; BCN, FECN,
E-FECN, QCN, AF-QCN and FQCN which are all queue-based
congestion notification algorithms.

value and probe is used to manage the congestion condition
along the path from the source to the destination [9]. If the
available bandwidth at switch is smaller than the value of the
rate field in the probe, rate field get modified along the
forward path. When the probe messages is received at the
sources from the destination, the rate regulator adjusts the
sending rate and allocate proper bandwidth to each link. At
the congestion point, the switch measures the average
arrival rate of each flow and the instantaneous queue length
during the interval.

2.1 Backward Congestion Notification (BCN)
As shown in Fig.1 BCN mechanism was introduced by
Bergasamo et al. at Cisco [6]. BCN is a rate-based closed-loop
feedback mechanism. BCN works in three phases:
Congestion Detection, Signaling, and Source Reaction.

Fig -2: Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN)
Fig -1: Backward Congestion Notification (BCN)

2.1.1 Congestion Detection:
As shown in above fig. 1, eq called as equilibrium queue
length and SC called as severe congestion queue length are
threshold values. First of all sampling is done at switch when
the incoming packets arrived and the probability P is
calculated. After sampling e, called as congestion measure is
calculated.
Fig -3: Enhanced Forward Explicit Congestion Notification
(FECN)

2.1.2 Backward Signaling:
BCN contains three kinds of signals: PAUSE frames, BCN
normal messages and BCN STOP messages. The arriving
packets at the switch are sampled and for each sampled
packet the feedback BCN message is generated [6] [12].

E-FECN operations assume the same operations as those in
FECN as shown in fig. 3. Here BCN00 message is used, which
is adapted by switch under the situation of severe
congestion.

2.1.3 Source Reaction:

2.3 Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN)

When a normal BCN message reaches the end station, e is
calculated and updated value get set for rate regulator. The
rate regulator tag (RRT) uses IEEE 802.1Q tag format [1] [6].
When a BCN message is received at the source, Additive
Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm is
used to adjust values at the rate regulator.

Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN) is developed for
IEEE 802.1Qau to provide congestion control at the Ethernet
Layer or Layer 2 by the IEEE Data Center Bridging Task
Group [5]. QCN is accepted as a formal standard. The
drawback of QCN is the rate unfairness of different flows
when sharing one bottleneck link. Basically it is having two
parts: Congestion Point (CP) and Rate Limiter (RL). At CP,
the switch is attached to oversubscribed link. Switch samples
incoming packets and send feedback about the severity level,
if any, to the source point. At one traffic source, RL decreases
its sending rate based on the congestion notification
message received from CP and increases its rate voluntarily

2.2 Forward Explicit Congestion Notification
(FECN) and Enhanced FECN (E-FECN)
FECN uses a close-loop explicit rate feedback control
mechanism. FECN uses rate based load sensor to detect the
congestion. At initial stage all flows are set to maximum

2.2 Fair Quantized Congestion Notification (FQCN)

to recover lost bandwidth then probe for extra available
bandwidth [10].

Fair Quantized Congestion Notification (FQCN) sends the
congestion message to each of the flow. Both QCN and FQCN
are differs only in CP algorithm and RL is implemented same
as there in QCN. QCN randomly samples the traffic packets at
CP and sends feedback to the congestion link where culprit is
observed. FQCN addresses following deficiencies: 1) It
identifies congestion culprits on the basis of the overrated
flow; 2) Through joint queue and per flow monitoring, it
feedbacks individual congestion status to each culprit
through multi-casting and this helps FQCN to achieve
statistical fairness Congestion Culprits Identification.

2.3.1 The CP Algorithm:
As shown in above fig. 4, Q is set as a threshold value. CP
maintain the occupancy of buffer at that particular value
called Equilibrium value. At time t, CP samples the incoming
packets with a sampling probability p(t) and then find out
the value of Fb.

Fig -4 Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN)

If feedback is negative, either the buffer or the link or both
are oversubscribed. Then congestion notification message
containing the value of quantized feedback, denoted as ΨFb
(t), is sent back to the source of the sampled packet;
otherwise no feedback message is sent. At each sampling
event, the sampling probability is updated. In the default
implementation, the congestion feedback value is quantized
to 6 bits and the maximum quantized value of feedback is 64,
so the maximum sampling probability is 10.

Fig-5 Fair Quantized Congestion Notification (FQCN)
If the calculated congestion feedback value is negative then
with the use of multi-casting, the congestion notification
message will be sent back to all identified overrated flows.
For each overrated flow, the quantized congestion feedback
value of the overrated flow is calculated.

2.3.2 The RL Algorithm:

Quantized congestion feedback value in each congestion
notification message is proportional to ΨFb(t). ΨFb(i,t)is
also quantized to 6 bits because Fb(t) is quantized to 6 bits.
Fig. 6 describes the FQCN system model having three
sources, sources 1 and 3 are identified as congestion culprits,
and the congestion notification message is fed back to
sources 1 and 3.

When congestion message is received from the CP, RL
adjust its sending rate. It either increase its sending rate to
recover the lost bandwidth or decrease based on the basis
of incoming feedback.
Rate decrease:
When feedback message is received, the current rate is set
as the target rate. Here value of feedback is reduced to
50%, mince Fb (t) = 1/2. In the default implementation,
the maximum quantized value of feedback is 64.

FQCN differs from both QCN and AF-QCN. QCN does not
distinguish flow dependent congestion information and
feedbacks the same congestion status to the source of the
randomly sampled packet, while the congestion feedback
value in the congestion notification message in both AF-QCN
and FQCN is flow dependent. Thus, resolving congestion at
switch is much faster with FQCN than that with QCN or AFQCN. Moreover, the signaling overhead of FQCN is lighter
than that of QCN and AF-QCN because congestion messages
could also be received by low rate sources, which are not the
real congestion culprits. AF-QCN can also identify congestion
culprits, but it still feeds congestion information only back to
the source of the randomly sampled packet.

Rate Increase
Two modules, Byte Counter (BC) and Rate Increase Timer
(RIT) are introduced in RL for rate increases. For counting
the number of bytes transmitted by the traffic at source BC is
used. Based on BC only, it will take a long time for a low rate
source to increase its sending rate. This may leads to low
bandwidth utilization if there is extra available bandwidth.
Rather than limiting bandwidth rate it increases bandwidth
utilization with the introduction of RIT. RIT also increases
the source’s sending rate periodically.

3.5 Congestion Regulation:

3. COMPARISONS AND DISCUSSION

The source rate in BCN, QCN and FQCN can be reduced more
quickly than that in FECN [8]. The message in BCN and QCN is
sent directly from the CP while the probe message in FECN
has to take a round trip before it get return to the source.
Using the BCN00 message in E-FECN, congestion adjustment
speed is improved.

All Congestion Notification algorithm such as-BCN, FECN, EFECN, QCN and FQCN summarized in Table 1. All of them are
concerned with provisioning congestion notification in
DCNs. We will discuss and compare the advantages and
disadvantages of these congestion notification algorithms in
the following aspects.

3.6 Throughput Oscillation:

3.1 Fairness:

BCN incurs large oscillations in throughput. FECN and EFECN do not incur large oscillations in source throughput. In
QCN and FQCN throughput oscillation is improved with the
rate increase determined jointly by Byte Counter and Rate
Increase Timer at the source.

BCN achieve only proportional fairness but not max-min
fairness. The fairness in FECN (EFECN) is calculated by the
congestion detection algorithm at the switch. Similar to BCN,
the feedback message is only sent to the source of the
sampled packet in QCN, and therefore QCN only achieves
proportional fairness rather than max-min fairness. One
drawback of QCN is the rate unfairness with respect to
different flows when sharing single bottleneck link. Such rate
unfairness also degrades the TCP throughput in synchronized
readings of data blocks across multiple servers. This
drawback is overcome by Fair Quantized Congestion
Notification (FQCN) [12], that improve the fairness of
multiple flows sharing single bottleneck link. The main aim of
FQCN is to feedback the global and per-flow congestion
information to all culprits when the switch is congested [1].

3.7 Load Sensor:
Queue dynamics in BCN, QCN and FQCN send back to the
sources, while FECN detect congestion. In addition to the
rate-based sensors, queue monitor is also employed for
severe congestion notification in EFECN.

3.8 Link Disconnection:
BCN, E-FECN, QCN and FQCN can employ the reactive
feedback message to inform the source when any link in
network get broken down and suddenly decrease or stop the
transmission of packets[7][1]. While in case of FECN, there is
no reactive feedback message and the probe might not return
back to the source thus causing packet loss.

3.2 Feedback Control:
From the system models shown in above figures, it is
observed that BCN, QCN and FQCN use backward feedback
control [10], FECN employs forward feedback and EFECN
implements BCN00 messages to inform the source about the
occurrence of congestion [1].

3.9 Fast Start:
The sources are initialized with the full rate in BCN, QCN and
FQCN and eventually ramp down if any negative feedback is
received from a switch. In FECN, the sources are initially at
lower rate and move to some threshold value, as successive
probes get returned [5].

3.3 Overhead:
High and unpredictable overhead is what BCN can provide.
QCN is having smaller overhead than that of BCN since there
is only negative QCN message to reduce the sending rate.
FECN is low in overhead but it can be predicted because the
FECN message is sent periodically with a small payload of
about 20 bytes [1]. E-FECN is having much larger overhead
than that of FECN due to the BCN00 signal involved in the EFECN algorithm. The Overhead of FQCN is medium and
unpredictable but smaller than that of QCN in multiple flows
sharing a single bottleneck link [9].

3.10 Number of Rate Regulators:

3.4 Rate of Convergence to Fair State:

BCN, QCN and FQCN use reactive signaling while FECN uses
proactive signaling and E-FECN employs both these signaling
methods. In proactive signaling probes are sent periodically,
so at least one periodic interval is needed to respond to the
sudden overload [12] advantages and disadvantages of the
major. This paper will useful in getting overall view of the
congestion notification algorithm along with difference in
their behavior

FECN requires regulators equal to the number of concurrent
flows. Number of rate regulators in E-FECN varies due to the
adaption of BCN000. In BCN, QCN and FQCN, the feedback
message is only sent to the source of the sampled packet and
therefore the number of rate regulators in them are varying
in nature [1].

3.11 Reactive and Proactive Signaling:

BCN is slow in convergence to the fair state. FECN and EFECN can achieve perfect fair state within a few RTT (Round
Trip Time) with all sources get the same feedback [1].
