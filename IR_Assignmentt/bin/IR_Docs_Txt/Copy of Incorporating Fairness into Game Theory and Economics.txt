Incorporating Fairness into Game Theory and Economics
By MATTHEW RABIN*
People like to help those who are helping them, and to hurt those who are

hurting them. Outcomes reflecting such motivations are called fairness equilibria. Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other's material
payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other's payoffs. It is
shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness
equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of
mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria
are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered, and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored. (JEL A12, A13,
D63, C70)

are also motivated to hurt those who hurt
them. If somebody is being nice to you,
fairness dictates that you be nice to him.
If somebody is being mean to you, fairness
allows-and vindictiveness dictates-that
you be mean to him.
Clearly, these emotions have economic
implications. If an employee has been exceptionally loyal, then a manger may feel
some obligation to treat that employee well,
even when it is not in his self-interest to do
so. Other examples of economic behavior
induced by social goals are voluntary reductions of water-use during droughts, conservation of energy to help solve the energy
crisis (as documented, for instance, in Kenneth E. Train et al. [1987]), donations to
public television stations, and many forms
of voluntary labor. (Burton A. Weisbrod
[1988] estimates that, in the United States,
the total value of voluntary labor is $74
billion annually.)
On the negative side, a consumer may not
buy a product sold by a monopolist at an
"unfair" price, even if the material value to
the consumer is greater than the price. By
not buying, the consumer lowers his own
material well-being so as to punish the
monopolist. An employee who feels she has
been mistreated by a firm may engage in
acts of sabotage. Members of a striking labor union may strike longer than is in their
material interests because they want to punish a firm for being unfair.

Most current economic models assume
that people pursue only their own material
self-interest and do not care about "social"
goals. One exception to self-interest which
has received some attention by economists
is simple altruism: people may care not only
about their own well-being, but also about
the well-being of others. Yet psychological
evidence indicates that most altruistic behavior is more complex: people do not seek
uniformly to help other people; rather, they
do so according to how generous these other
people are being. Indeed, the same people
who are altrustic to other altruistic people

By modeling such emotions formally, one
can begin to understand their economic and
welfare implications more rigorously and
more generally. In this paper, I develop a
game-theoretic framework for incorporating
such emotions into a broad range of economic models.1 My framework incorporates
the following three stylized facts:

situations are likely to be fairness equilibria.
The results demonstrate the special role of

"mutual-max" outcomes (in which, given the
other person's behavior, each person maxi-

mizes the other's material payoffs) and
"mutual-min" outcomes (in which, given the
other person's behavior, each person mini-

mizes the other's material payoffs). The following results hold:

(A) People are willing to sacrifice their own
material well-being to help those who
are being kind.

(B) People are willing to sacrifice their own
material well-being to punish those who
are being unkind.
(C) Both motivations (A) and (B) have a
greater effect on behavior as the material cost of sacrificing becomes smaller.

In the next section, I briefly present some
of the evidence from the psychological literature regarding these stylized facts. In Section II, I develop a game-theoretic solution
concept "fairness equilibrium" that incorporates these stylized facts. Fairness equilibria do not in general constitute either a
subset or a superset of Nash equilibria; that
is, incorporating fairness considerations can
both add new predictions to economic models and eliminate conventional predictions.
In Section III, I present some general results about which outcomes in economic

'While many recognize the importance of social
motivations in economic phenomena, these emotions
have not been investigated widely within the formal
apparatus of mainstream economics. Other researchers

who have done so include George Akerlof (1982),
Peter H. Huang and Ho-Mou Wu (1992), Vai-Lam Mui
(1992), and Julio J. Rotemberg (1992); but these and
other economic models have tended to be contextspecific. While the current version of my model only
applies to two-person complete-information games, it
applies to all such games. If it is extended naturally, it
will therefore have specific consequences in any economic or social situation that can be modeled by noncooperative game theory. (By its generality, my model
may also contribute to psychological research. While
some psychology researchers have tried to formulate
general principles of behavior, I believe that noncooperative game theory provides a useful language for
doing so more carefully. My model, for instance, helps
demonstrate that some seemingly different behaviors in
different contexts are explicable by common underlying
principles.)

(i) Any Nash equilibrium that is either a

mutual-max outcome or mutual-min
outcome is also a fairness equilibrium.
(ii) If material payoffs are small, then,
roughly, an outcome is a fairness equilibrium if and only if it is a mutual-max
or a mutual-min outcome.
(iii) If material payoffs are large, then,
roughly, an outcome is a fairness equilibrium if and only if it is a Nash equilibrium.

I hope this framework will eventually be
used to study the implications of fairness in
different economic situations. While I do
not develop extended applications in this
paper, Section IV contains examples illustrating the economic implications of my
model of fairness. I develop a simple model
of monopoly pricing and show that fairness
implies that goods can only be sold at below
the classical monopoly price. I then explore
the implications of fairness in an extended
labor example.
I consider some welfare implications of
my model in Section V. Many researchers in
welfare economics have long considered issues of fairness to be important in evaluating the desirability of different economic
outcomes. Yet while such policy analysis
incorporates economists' judgments of fairness and equity, it often ignores the concerns for fairness and equity of the economic actors being studied. By considering
how people's attitudes toward fairness influence their behavior and well-being, my
framework can help incorporate such concerns more directly into policy analysis and
welfare economics.
While my model suggests that the behavioral implications of fairness are greatest
when the material consequences of an economic interaction are not too large, there

are several reasons why this does not imply

that the economic implications of fairness
are minor. First, while it is true that fairness
influences behavior most when material
stakes are small, it is not clear that it makes
little difference when material stakes are
large. Little empirical research on the economic implications of fairness has been conducted, and much anecdotal evidence suggests that people sacrifice substantial
amounts of money to reward or punish kind
or unkind behavior. Second, many major
economic institutions, most notably decentralized markets, are best described as accumulations of minor economic interactions,
so that the aggregate implications of departures from standard theory in these cases
may be substantial. Third, the fairness component of a person's overall well-being can
be influenced substantially by even small
material changes.
Finally, even if material incentives in a
situation are so large as to dominate behavior, fairness still matters. Welfare economics should be concerned not only with
the efficient allocation of material goods,
but also with designing institutions such that
people are happy about the way they interact with others. For instance, if a person
leaves an exchange in which he was treated
unkindly, then his unhappiness at being so
treated should be a consideration in evaluating the efficiency of that exchange. Armed
with well-founded psychological assumptions, economists can start to address the
nonmaterial benefits and costs of the free
market and other institutions.2
I conclude the paper in Section VI with a
discussion of some of the shortfalls of my
model and an outline of possible extensions.

I. Fairness in Games: Some Evidence

In this section, I discuss some psychological research that demonstrates the stylized
facts outlined in the Introduction. Consider
fact A: "People are willing to sacrifice their
own material well-being to help those who
are being kind." The attempt to provide
public goods without coercion is an arche-

typical example in which departures from
pure self-interest can be beneficial to society, and it has been studied by psychologists
as a means of testing for the existence of
altruism and cooperation. Laboratory experiments of public goods have been conducted
by, among others, John M. Orbell (1978),

Gerald Marwell and Ruth Ames (1981),
Werner Guth (1982), Alphons J. C. van de
Kragt et al. (1983), R. Mark Isaac et al.
(1984, 1985), Oliver Kim and Mark Walker
(1984), James Andreoni (1988a, b), and Isaac
James Walker (1988a, b). These experiments
typically involve subjects choosing how much
to contribute toward a public good, where
the self-interested contribution is small or
zero. The evidence from these experiments
is that people cooperate to a degree greater
than would be implied by pure self-interest.

Many of these experiments are surveyed in
Robyn M. Dawes and Richard H. Thaler
(1988), who conclude that, for most experiments of one-shot public-good decisions in
which the individually optimal contribution
is close to 0 percent, the contribution rate
ranges between 40 percent and 60 percent

of the socially optimal level.3
These experiments indicate that contributions toward public goods are not, however,
the result of "pure altruism," where people
seek unconditionally to help others. Rather,
the willingness to help seems highly contingent on the behavior of others. If people do
not think that others are doing their fair
share, then their enthusiasm for sacrificing
for others is greatly diminished.

2Indeed, I show in Section V that there exist situations in which the unique fairness equilibrium leaves

both players feeling that they have been treated un-

kindly. This means that negative emotions may be
endogenously generated by particular economic structures. I also state and prove an unhappy theorem:

every game contains at least one such "unkind equilibrium." That is, there does not exist any situation in
which players necessarily depart with positive feelings.

3Further examples of stylized fact A can be found in
Richard E. Goranson and Leonard Berkowitz (1966),
Martin Greenberg and David Frisch (1972), Elizabeth
Hoffman and Matthew Spitzer (1982), and Daniel Kahneman et al. (1986a,b).

1284 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW DECEMBER 1993

Indeed, stylized fact B says that people
will in some situations not only refuse to
help others, but will sacrifice to hurt others
who are being unfair. This idea has been
most widely explored in the "ultimatum
game," discussed at length in Thaler (1988).
The ultimatum game consists of two people
splitting some fixed amount of money X
according to the following rules: a "proposer" offers some division of X to a "decider." If the decider says yes, they split the
money according to the proposal. If the
decider says no, they both get no money.
The result of pure self-interest is clear: proposers will never offer more than a penny,
and deciders should accept any offer of at
least a penny. Yet experiments clearly reject
such behavior. Data show that, even in oneshot settings, deciders are willing to punish
unfair offers by rejecting them, and proposers tend to make fair offers.4 Some papers illustrating stylized fact B are Goranson and Berkowitz (1966), Jerald Greenberg
(1978), Guth et al. (1982), Kahneman et al.

(1986a,b), and Alvin E. Roth et al. (1991).
Stylized fact C says that people will not
be as willing to sacrifice a great amount of
money to maintain fairness as they would be
with small amounts of money. It is tested
and partially confirmed in Gerald Leventhal
and David Anderson (1970), but its validity
is intuitive to most people. If the ultimatum
game were conducted with $1, then most
deciders would reject a proposed split of
($0.90, $0.10). If the ultimatum game were
conducted with $10 million, the vast majority of deciders would accept a proposed
split of ($9 million, $1 million).5 Consider
also the following example from Dawes and
Thaler (1988 p. 145):

In the rural areas around Ithaca it is
common for farmers to put some fresh
produce on a table by the road. There
is a cash box on the table, and customers are expected to put money in
the box in return for the vegetables
they take. The box has just a small slit,
so money can only be put in, not taken
out. Also, the box is attached to the
table, so no one can (easily) make off
with the money. We think that the
farmers who use this system have just
about the right model of human nature. They feel that enough people
will volunteer to pay for the fresh corn
to make it worthwhile to put it out
there. The farmers also know that if it
were easy enough to take the money,
someone would do so.

This example is in the spirit of stylized fact
C: people succumb to the temptation to
pursue their interests at the expense of others in proportion to the profitability of doing so.

From an economist's point of view, it
matters not only whether stylized facts A-C
are true, but whether they have important
economic implications. Kahneman et al.

(1986a, b) present strong arguments that
these general issues are indeed important.
For anyone unconvinced of the importance
of social goals empirically or intuitively, one
purpose of this paper is to help test the
proposition theoretically: will adding fairness to economic models substantially alter
conclusions? If so, in what situations will
conclusions be altered, and in what way?

To formalize fairness, I adopt the framework developed by John Geanakoplos,
David Pearce, and Ennio Stacchetti (1989)

beliefs substantially complicates analysis, I
argue that the approach is necessary to capture aspects of fairness. Fortunately, GPS
show that many standard techniques and
results have useful analogues in these "psychological games."
In developing my model of fairness, I
extend the GPS approach with an additional step which I believe will prove essential for incorporating psychology into economic research: I derive psychological games
from basic "material games." Whereas GPS
provide a technique for analyzing games
that already incorporate emotions, I use
assumptions about fairness to derive psychological games from the more traditional
material description of a situation. Doing

so, I develop a model that can be applied
generally and can be compared directly to
standard economic analysis.
To motivate both the general framework
and my specific model, consider Example 1
(see Fig. 1), where X is a positive number.
(Throughout the paper, I shall represent
games with the positive "scale variable" X.
This allows me to consider the effects of
increasing or decreasing a game's stakes
without changing its fundamental strategic

structure.) This is a standard battle-of-thesexes game: two people prefer to go to the
same event together, but each prefers a
different event. Formally, both players prefer to play either (opera, opera) or (boxing,
boxing) rather than not coordinating; but
player 1 prefers (opera, opera), and player 2
prefers (boxing, boxing).
The payoffs are a function only of the
moves made by the players. Suppose, however, that player 1 (say) cares not only about
his own payoff, but depending on player 2's
motives, he cares also about player 2's pay-

off. In particular, if player 2 seems to be
intentionally helping player 1, then player 1
will be motivated to help player 2; if player
2 seems to be intentionally hurting player 1,
then player 1 will wish to hurt player 2.
Suppose player 1 believes (a) that player
2 is playing boxing, and (b) that player 2
believes player 1 is playing boxing. Then
player 1 concludes that player 2 is choosing
an action that helps both players (playing
opera would hurt both players). Because
player 2 is not being either generous or
mean, neither stylized fact A nor B applies.
Thus, player 1 will be neutral about his
effect on player 2 and will pursue his material self-interest by playing boxing. If this
argument is repeated for player 2, one can
show that, in the natural sense, (boxing,
boxing) is an equilibrium: if it is common
knowledge that this will be the outcome,
then each player is maximizing his utility by
playing his strategy.
Of course, (boxing, boxing) is a conventional Nash equilibrium in this game. To see
the importance of fairness, suppose player 1
believes (a) that player 2 will play boxing,
and (b) that player 2 believes that player 1 is
playing opera. Now player 1 concludes that
player 2 is lowering her own payoff in order
to hurt him. Player 1 will therefore feel
hostility toward player 2 and will wish to
harm her. If this hostility is strong enough,
player 1 may be willing to sacrifice his own
material well-being, and play opera rather
than boxing. Indeed, if both players have a

strong enough emotional reaction to each
other's behavior, then (opera, boxing) is an
equilibrium. If it is common knowledge that
they are playing this outcome, then, in the
induced atmosphere of hostility, both players will wish to stick with it.
Notice the central role of expectations:
player l's payoffs do not depend simply on
the actions taken, but also on his beliefs
about player 2's motives. Could these emotions be directly modeled by transforming
the payoffs, so that one could analyze this
transformed game in the conventional way?
This turns out to be impossible. In the natural sense, both of the equilibria discussed
above are strict: each player strictly prefers
to play his strategy given the equilibrium. In

the equilibrium (boxing, boxing), player 1

what payoffs are chosen, these statements
would be contradictory if payoffs depended

these preferences, therefore, it is necessary
to develop a model that explicitly incorporates beli-efs.7 I now construct such a model,
applicable to all two-person, finite-strategy
games.

From this "material game," I now construct a "psychological game" as defined in
GPS. I assume that each player's subjective
expected utility when he chooses his strategy will depend on three factors: (i) his
strategy, (ii) his beliefs about the other
player's strategy choice, and (iii) his beliefs
about the other player's beliefs about his
strategy. Throughout, I shall use the follow-

fl(bj) {(wi(a, bj), wj(bj, a)) a E Si}]. The

players might have a variety of notions of
how kind player i is being by choosing any

given point in 11(bj). While I shall now

proceed with a specific (and purposely simplistic) measure of kindness, I show in the
Appendix that the results of this paper are
valid for any kindness function that specifies
the equitable payoffs as some rule for shar-

ing notation: a1 E SI and a2 E S2 representing along the Pareto frontier.

about what player 2 believes player l's strategy is, and player 2's beliefs about what
player 1 believes player 2's strategy is.

7My point here is that the results I get could not be
gotten simply by respecifying the payoffs over the physical actions in the game. Van Kolpin (1993) argues that
one can apply conventional game theory to these games
by including the choice of beliefs as additional parts of

plavers' strategies.
I shall emphasize pure strategies in this paper,

though formal definitions allow for mixed strategies,
and all stated results apply to them. One reason I
de-emphasize mixed strategies is that the characterization of preferences over mixed strategies is not
straightforward. In psychological games, there can be a
difference between interpreting mixed strategies literally as purposeful mixing by a player versus interpreting them as uncertainty by other players. Such issues of
interpretation are less important in conventional game
theory, and consequently incorporating mixed strategies is more straightforward.

Pareto frontier is linear, this payoff literally
corresponds to the payoff player j would get
if player i "splits the difference" with her
among Pareto-efficient points. More generally, it provides a crude reference point
against which to measure how generous
player i is being to player j. Finally, let
7wmin(bj) be the worst possible payoff for

player j in the set fl(bj).

From these payoffs, I define the kindness
function. This function captures how much

more than or less than player j's equitable payoff player i believes he is giving to
player j.

While this is perhaps correct if people enjoy making
suckers of others, it is more likely that a player will feel
guilty if he is mean to somebody who is nice to him.

ing (or hurting) player 2 as a function of
player 2's behavior.13
The second issue that the prisoner's
dilemma illustrates is the role of intentionality in attitudes about fairness. Psychological evidence indicates that people determine the fairness of others according to
their motives, not solely according to actions taken.14 In game-theoretic terms,
"motives" can be inferred from a player's
choice of strategy from among those choices
he has, so what strategy a player could have
chosen (but did not) can be as important as
what strategy he actually chooses. For example, people differentiate between those
who take a generous action by choice and
those who are forced to do so. Consider
Example 3, depicted in Figure 3.

This is the "prisoner's dilemma" in which
player 2 is forced to cooperate. It corre-

sponds, for instance, to a case in which
someone is forced to contribute to a public
good. In this degenerate game, player 1 will
always defect, so the unique fairness equi-

librium is (defect, cooperate). This contrasts
to the possibility of the (cooperate, cooperate) equilibrium in the prisoner's dilemma.
The difference is that now player 1 will feel
no positive regard for player 2's "decision"
to cooperate, because player 2 is not volun-

Let G(X)e -' be the game corresponding

Consider Chicken again. It can be verified
that, if X is small enough, then both (dare,
dare) and (chicken, chicken) are fairness
equilibria. Note that, while these two outcomes are (respectively) mutual-min and
mutual-max outcomes, they are not Nash
equilibria. Yet, when X is small, the fact
that they are not equilibria in the "material"
game is unimportant, because fairness considerations will start to dominate. Proposition 3 shows that the class of "strict"
mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes are
fairness equilibria for X small enough.

There are two caveats to this being a
general characterization of the set of fair-

ness equilibria in low-payoff games. First,
Proposition 3 does not necessarily hold for
mutual-max or mutual-min outcomes in
which players are giving each other the equitable payoffs (i.e., when the outcomes are
neutral). Thus, "non-strict" mutual-max and
mutual-min outcomes need to be doublechecked. Second, it is also necessary to
check whether certain types of Nash equilibria in the original game are also fairness
equilibria, even though they are neither mutual-max nor mutual-min outcomes. The potentially problematic Nash equilibria are
those in which one of the players has no
options that will lower the other's material
payoffs.

I now turn to the case in which material
payoffs are very large. Proposition 5 states

that, for all X E (0, X), (a1, a2) is a fairness

While Proposition 3 gives sufficient conditions for outcomes to be fairness equilibria

some non-strict Nash equilibria are not fairness equilibria.
IV. Two Applications

One context in which fairness has been
studied is monopoly pricing (see e.g., Thaler,
1985; Kahneman et al., 1986a,b). Might
consumers see conventional monopoly
prices as unfair and refuse to buy at such
prices even when worth it in material terms?
If this is the case, then even a profit-maximizing monopolist would price below the
level predicted by standard economic theory. I now present a game-theoretic model
of a monopoly and show that this intuition
is an implication of fairness equilibrium.
I assume that a monopolist has costs c
per unit of production, and a consumer
values the product at v. These are common
knowledge. The monopolist picks a price

p E [c, v] as the consumer simultaneously
picks a "reservation" price r E [c, v], above
which he is not willing to pay. If p < r, then
the good is sold at price p, and the payoffs
are p - c for the monopolist and v - p for
the consumer. If p> r, then there is no
sale, and the payoffs are 0 for each player.
Though this is formally an infinite-strategy
game, it can be analyzed using my model of
fairness.18 Applying Nash equilibrium allows
any outcome. We might, however, further
narrow our prediction, because the strategy
r = v for the consumer weakly dominates all
other strategies (this would also be the result of subgame perfection if this were a
sequential game, with the monopolist setting the price first). Thus, if players cared
only about material payoffs, a reasonable
outcome in this game is the equilibrium
where p = r = v, so that the monopolist extracts all the surplus from trade.

What is the highest price consistent with
a fairness equilibrium at which this product
could be sold? First, what is the function

fc(r, p), how fair the consumer is being to
the monopolist? Given that the monopolist
sets p, the only question is whether the
monopolist gets profits p - c or profits 0. If
r 2 p, then the consumer is maximizing both
the monopolist's and his own payoffs, so

fc(r, p) = 0. If r < p, then the consumer is
minimizing the monopolist's payoffs, so
fc(r, p) = - 1. One implication of this is that
the monopolist will always exploit its position, because it will never feel positively
toward the consumer; thus, r > p cannot be
a fairness equilibrium.
Because r < p leads to no trade, this
means that the only possibility for an equilibrium with trade is when p = r. How fair
is the monopolist being to the consumer
when p = r = z? Calculations show that

fM(z,z)=[c-z]/2[v-c]. Because I am

considering only values of z between c and
v, this number is negative. Any time the
monopolist is not setting a price equal to its
costs, the consumer thinks that the
monopolist is being unfair. This is because
the monopolist is choosing the price that
extracts as much surplus as possible from
the consumer, given the consumer's refusal
to buy at a price higher than z.
To see whether p = r = z is a fairness
equilibrium for a given z, one must see
whether the consumer would wish to deviate by setting r < z, thus eliminating the
monopolist's profits. The consumer's total
utility from r < z is

UC=O+fM(Z,z) [1+ -1] =0.
The consumer's total utility from sticking
with strategy r = z is

18Note, however, that I have artificially limited the
strategy spaces of the players, requiring them to make
only mutually beneficial offers; there are problems with
the definitions of this paper if the payoff space of a
game is unbounded. Moreover, though I believe that
all results would be qualitatively similar with more
realistic models, the exact answers provided here are
sensitive to the specification of the strategy space.

UC = V-z + fM(Z, Z) [1 +0]
= v - z + [c - z]/2[v - c].

Calculations show that the highest price
consistent with fairness equilibrium is given

by

z* = [2v2-2cu + c]/[1 + 2v-2c].
This number is strictly less than v when
v > c. Thus, the highest equilibrium price
possible is lower than the conventional
monopoly price when fairness is added to
the equation. This reflects the arguments of
Kahneman et al. (1986a, b): a monopolist
interested in maximizing profits ought not
to set price at "the monopoly price," because it should take consumers' attitudes
toward fairness as a given.
I can further consider some limit results
as the stakes become large in this game. Let
the monopolist's costs and the consumer's
value be C cX and V uX, respectively. I
represent the percentage of surplus that the

monopolist is able to extract by (z*- C)(V - C). Algebra shows that this equals
[2(V - C)/[1 + 2(V - C)], and the limit of
this as X becomes arbitrarily large is 1.
That is, the monopolist is able to extract
"practically all" of the surplus, because rejecting an offer for the sake of fairness is
more costly for the consumer.
Another interesting implication of the
model is that dz*/dc > 0 for all parameter
values. This means that the higher are the
monopolist's costs, the higher the price the
consumer will be willing to pay (assuming
that the consumer knows the firm's costs).
This is one interpretation of the results presented in Thaler (1985): consumers are willing to pay more for the same product from
a high-cost firm than from a low-cost firm.
An area of economics where fairness has

been widely discussed (more so than in
monopoly pricing) is labor economics.19 I
now present an extended example that resembles the "gift-exchange" view of the employment relationship discussed in Akerlof

(1982). Consider the situation in which a
worker chooses an effort level and the firm
simultaneously chooses a benefit level for

the worker.20 Formally, the worker chooses
either a high or low effort level: e E {H, L}.
If e = H, the firm receives revenue R > 0,
and the worker receives disutility y. If e = L,
the firm receives no revenue, and the worker
experiences no disutility. Simultaneously,
the firm chooses a benefit level b e [0, R].
Material payoffs are as follows:

/b1/2-y if e=H

w bl/2 if e=L
rt(R - b)1/2 if e= H and b < R

F 0 if e=Lorb>R

where 7rW is the worker's material payoffs,
and WF is the firm's material payoffs.21
This situation is essentially a continuousstrategy prisoner's dilemma, because each
player has a dominant strategy: the worker
maximizes his material payoffs by choosing
e = L, and the firm maximizes its material
payoffs by choosing b = 0. Thus, the unique
Nash equilibrium is the nasty one in which
e = L and b = 0. Because this outcome is
also a mutual-min outcome, this will be a
fairness equilibrium in which the players
feel negatively toward each other.
I now consider the possibility of a positive
fairness equilibrium. First observe that the

kindness of the worker to the firm is fw =
if the worker puts in high effort, and fw =
-- if the worker puts in low effort. This is
because e = H involves the worker fully
yielding along the Pareto frontier to the
firm, and e = L means that the worker is
choosing the best Pareto-efficient point for
himself, given the firm's choice of b.
Given the worker's choice of effort, the
kindest the firm can be to the worker is to
choose b= R; the least kind is clearly to
choose b = 0. Therefore the equitable material payoff to the worker is R1/2/2- y if

e = H, and R1/2/2 if e = L. Using this, one
19For some examples discussing the role in labor
economics of fairness and related issues, see Akerlof
(1982), John Bishop (1987), James N. Baron (1988),
David I. Levine (1991, 1993), and Rotemberg (1992). In
Rabin (1992), I applied this model of fairness to several
more examples from labor economics.

20This model is a version of one suggested to me by
James Montgomery (pers. comm.).

21The assumptions that the parties are risk-averse
and that the firm's payoff is 0 (rather than negative) if
e = L are made for convenience and are not essential.

can calculate that the kindness of the firm

to the worker is given by fF = (b/R)1/2 Using this, consider the possibility of a
positive fairness equilibrium. What is the
firm's utility if it is commonly known that
the worker is setting e = H? It is given by

Player 1
Share O,2X X,X

UF = (R - b)1/2+ [2 + (b/R)1/2J
FIGURE 5. EXAMPLE 5: THE GRABBING GAME

Thus, the firm will maximize its utility by
setting dUF 7db = 0, and one gets the result

that b* = R /(1+ 4R). With this level of b,
the firm's kindness to the worker is fF =

[1/(1 + 4R)]'/2 Finally, in order for this to constitute a
fairness equilibrium, it must be that the
worker would wish to set e = H rather than
e = L. The two possible utility levels are:

Uw(e H) = b1/2 _ y

+ ([1(1+4R)] 1/2_

Uw(e L) = b1/2
+ ([1(1+4R)] 1/2 1}(- )
Algebra yields the conclusion that the
worker would not strictly prefer to choose
e = L if and only if

R < 0.25[1/(0.5 + Y)1/2_1].
For all such combinations of R and y,
therefore, there exists a "gift-giving" equilibrium in which the worker sets e = H, and
the firm gives the worker a bonus of b* =
R /(1 + 4R). Note that the larger is y, the
smaller R must be for there to exist a gift-

In fact, if y 2 2, then there is no giftgiving equilibrium, no matter how small is
R. This is because the firm's material incentives are such that it will choose to be
unkind to the worker, so that the worker
will choose to be unkind to the firm. Thus,
overall the model says that workers and
firms will cooperate if neither is too tempted
by material concerns to cheat.
V. Fairness and Welfare

I consider now some welfare implications
of fairness.22 My perspective here is that
the full utility functions (combining material
payoffs and "fairness payoffs") are the utility functions with which to determine social
welfare. As such, I believe one should care
not solely about how concerns for fairness
support or interfere with material efficiency,
but also about how these concerns affect
people's overall welfare.
Consider Example 5 (see Fig. 5). In this
game, two people are shopping, and there
are two cans of soup left. Each person can
either try to grab both cans, or not try to
grab. If both grab or both do not grab, they
each get one can; if one grabs, and the

giving equilibrium. The rpason for this is
roughly as follows. If y is large, the worker
is very tempted to "cheat" the firm by not
working hard. The only way he will not

cheat is if the firm is being very kind. But
the firm's material costs to yielding a given
percentage of profits to the worker increases as R increases; thus, only if R is
very small will the firm give the worker a
generous enough share of profits to induce
the worker to be kind.

22Robert H. Frank (1988, 1990) and others have
explored how the existence of various emotions are
understandable as adaptive evolutionary features of
humans. While this view of emotions as "adaptive"
may be broadly correct, Frank himself emphasizes that
emotions can also be destructive in many situations.
People's propensity for revenge can be harmful as well
as helpful. My model of people's preferences for fairness will help economists do exactly what is done with
"material" preferences-study how these preferences
play out in different economic settings.

prisoner's dilemma: each player has a dominant strategy, and the unique Nash equilibrium is (grab, grab). As in the prisoner's
dilemma, the noncooperative (grab, grab)
outcome is a fairness equilibrium, no matter
the value of X. For small X, however, the
positive, mutual-max outcome (share, share)
is also a fairness equilibrium. Moreover,
because these two fairness equilibria yield
the same material payoffs, (share, share)
always Pareto-dominates (grab, grab).
Shopping for minor items is a situation in
which people definitely care about material
payoffs, and this concern drives the nature
of the interaction; but they probably do not
care a great deal about individual items. If
two people fight over a couple of cans of
goods, the social grief and bad tempers are
likely to be of greater importance to the
people than whether they get the cans. Indeed, while both (grab, grab) and (share,
share) are fairness equilibria when material
payoffs are arbitrarily small, the overall utility in each equilibrium is bounded away
from zero.23 As the material payoffs involved
become arbitrarily small, equilibrium utility
levels do not necessarily become arbitrarily
small. This is realistic: no matter how minor
the material implications, people's wellbeing is affected by the friendly or unfriendly behavior of others.
In Example 5, as with many examples in
this paper, there is both a strictly positive

and a strictly negative fairness equilibrium.
Are there games that contain only positive
or only negative fairness equilibria? If there
are, this could be interpreted as saying that
there are some economic situations that endogenously determine the friendliness or
hostility of the people involved. More generally, one could consider the question of

which types of economic structures are likely
to generate which types of emotions.
The prisoner's dilemma illustrates that
there do exist situations that endogenously

generate hostility. Applying Proposition 5,
the only fairness equilibrium of the prisoner's dilemma with very large material
payoffs is the Nash equilibrium, where both
players defect. This fairness equilibrium is
strictly negative. Interpreting a negative
fairness equilibrium as a situation in which
parties become hostile to each other, this
implies that if mutual cooperation is beneficial, but each person has an irresistible
incentive to cheat when others are cooperating, then people will leave the situation
feeling hostile.
Are there opposite, happier situations, in
which the strategic logic of a situation dictates that people will depart on good terms?
In other words, are there games for which
all fairness equilibria yield strictly positive
outcomes? Proposition 6 shows that the answer is no.24

PROPOSITION 6: In every game, there exists a weakly negative fairness equilibrium.

Proposition 6 states that it is never guaranteed that people will part with positive
feelings. It implies a strong asymmetry in
my model of fairness: there is a bias toward
negative feelings. What causes this asymmetry? Recall that if a player is maximizing his
own material payoffs, then he is being either
mean or neutral to the other player, because being "nice" inherently involves sacrificing material well-being. Thus, while there
are situations in which material self-interest
tempts a player to be mean even if other
players are being kind, material self-interest
will never tempt a player to be kind when
other players are being mean, because the

VI. Discussion and Conclusion

The notion of fairness in this paper captures several important regularities of behavior but leaves out other issues. Evidence
indicates, for instance, that people's notions
of fairness are heavily influenced by the
status quo and other reference points. For
instance, Kahneman et al. (1986a,b) illustrate that the consumer's view of the fairness of prices charged by a firm can be
heavily influenced by what that firm has
charged in the past.
Extending the model to more general situations will create issues that do not arise in
the simple two-person, normal-form, complete-information games discussed in this
paper. The central distinction between
two-person games and multiperson games is
likely to be how a person behaves when he
is hostile to some players but friendly toward others. The implications are clear if he
is able to choose whom to help and whom
to hurt; it is more problematic if he must
choose either to help everybody or to hurt
everybody, such as when choosing the contribution level to a public good. Does one
contribute to reward those who have contributed or not contribute to punish those
who have not contributed.
Extending the model to incomplete-information games is essential for applied re-

search, but doing so will lead to important
new issues. Because the theory depends so
heavily on the motives of other players, and
because interpreting other players' motives
depends on beliefs about their payoffs and
information, incomplete information is likely
to have a dramatic effect on decision-making. Extending the model to sequential
games is also essential for applied research.
In conventional game theory, observing past
behavior can provide information; in psychological games, it can conceivably change
the motivations of the players. An important issue arises: can players "force" emotions; that is, can a first-mover do something
that will compel a second player to regard
him positively? One might imagine, for instance, that an analogue to Proposition 6

Trust 6X,6X 0,12X
Player 1

Dissolve 5X,5X 5X,5X

FIGURE 6. EXAMPLE 6: LEAVING A PARTNERSHIP

might no longer be true, and sequential
games could perhaps be used as mechanisms that guarantee positive emotions.
Finally, future research can also focus on
modeling additional emotions. In Example
6, for instance, my model predicts no cooperation, whereas it seems plausible that cooperation would take place (see Fig. 6).25
This game represents the following situation. Players 1 and 2 are partners on a
project that has thus far yielded total profits
of 1OX. Player 1 must now withdraw from
the project. If player 1 dissolves the partnership, the contract dictates that the players split the profits fifty-fifty. But total profits would be higher if player 1 leaves his
resources in the project. To do so, however,
he must forgo his contractual rights and
trust player 2 to share the profits after the
project is completed. So, player 1 must decide whether to "dissolve" or to "trust"; if
he trusts player 2, then player 2 can either
"grab" or "share."
What will happen? According to the notion of fairness in this paper, the only
(pure-strategy) equilibrium is for player 1 to

split the profits now, yielding an inefficient
solution. The desirable outcome (trust,
share) is not possible because player 2 will
deviate. The reason is that he attributes no
positive motive to player 1-while it is true
that player 1 trusted player 2, he did so
simply to increase his own expected material payoff. No kindness was involved.
One might think that (trust, share) is a
reasonable outcome. This would be the outcome, for instance, if it is assumed that

Fearon (pers. comm.).

players wish to be kind to those who trust
them. If player 1 plays "trust" rather than
"split," he is showing he trusts player 2. If
player 2 feels kindly toward player 1 as a
result of this trust, then he might not grab
all the profits. If it is concluded that the
idea that people are motivated to reward
trust is psychologically sound, then it could
be incorporated into formal models.
APPENDIX A:

THE KINDNESS FUNCTION CAN BE
GENERALIZED

There is a broad class of kindness functions for which all of the results of this
paper hold. Indeed, the proofs of all results
contained in the body of the paper are
general enough that they establish the results for the kindness functions that I now

In order for these results to hold, one must
guarantee that notions of the fairness of

change when all payoffs are doubled (say).
Definition A3 is a natural way to do so.

1298 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW DECEMBER 1993

One natural way to expand the utility

the kindness function as

function to incorporate pure altruism would

g(ai, bj)

be as follows:
j(bj , a).- rje(bj)

Ui(ai, bj, ci)

(1 - y)[ Tjh(bj)- 7'rin(bj) + y(7rmax _ 7rmin)]

-ri(ai, bj)

where wrax and <r"m are player j's maximum and minimum payoffs in the entire
game. This kindness function is well-defined
for all y E (0,1], so long as Tjmax + Trn
(which is true unless one has a game in
which no decisions by either player could
possibly affect player j's payoff). A second
type of discontinuity in the kindness functions is that 7r-(b2) can be discontinuous in
b2. This discontinuity can be smoothed out
with the following definition: for D > 0, let

72e( b2, D)

where a E [0, 1].
In this utility function, if a > 0, then the

player i will wish to be kind to player j even
if player j is being "neutral" to player i.
The relative importance of pure versus contingent altruism is captured by the parameter a; if a is small, then outcomes will be

much as in the model of this paper; if a is
close to 1, then pure altruism will dominate
behavior.

- maxb EB2{7r2(b*) + Dlb2 - b*11}.
It can be shown that 72-(b2, D) is a welldefined function and is continuous in b2. To
construct a continuous kindness function
(and thus allow the application of the GPS

existence proof), one need merely replace
7w by wr(b2, D) in the above definition. It
can be shown (proof available from the author upon request) that there exists a D > 0
defined for each game such that the resulting kindness function satisfies Definitions
Al, A2, and A3 for all y. Moreover, by
choosing y arbitrarily close to 0 and D
arbitrarily large, one essentially defines
kindness functions that are "smoothed" versions of that used in the paper.
While the precise kindness function used
is not important to the qualitative results of
this paper, the way I specify the overall
utility function is perhaps more restrictive.
One aspect that clearly determines some of
the results in this paper is the fact that I
completely exclude "pure altruism"; that is,
I assume that unless player 2 is being kind
to player 1, player 1 will have no desire to
be kind to player 2. Psychological evidence
suggests that, while people are substantially
motivated by the type of "contingent altruism" I have incorporated into the model,
pure altruism can also sometimes be important.

+ [ a + (1- a)fj(bj, ci)] [1 + fi(ai, bj)]

As discussed above with regard to the
kindness function, my model assumes that
the fairness utility is completely independent of the scale of the material payoffs.
Consider a situation in which a proposer's
offer to split $1 evenly is rejected by a
decider. My model says that the proposer
will leave the situation unhappy not only
because he has no money, but because he
was badly treated. Yet my model implies
that the proposer will be as unhappy, but no
more so, when leaving a situation in which
the decider rejected an offer to split $1
million evenly.
This seems unrealistic-the bitterness he
feels should be larger the greater the harm
done. The assumption could, however, be
relaxed while maintaining all the general
results of the paper. I could specify the
utility function as:
Ui(ai, bj, ci)

- ri(ai, bj) + G(X) - fj(bj, ci) [1 + fi(ai, bj)]
where G(X) is positive and increasing
in X.26

26This specification and one of the conditions mentioned to maintain the limit results were suggested by
Roland Benabou (pers. comm.).

the material well-being of the other player,
this must maximize his overall utility.
Next, suppose that (a1, a2) is a mutual-min

outcome. Then f1 and f2 will both be nonpositive, so that each player will be motivated to decrease the material well-being of
the other. Since he is doing so while simultaneously maximizing his own material
well-being, this must maximize his utility.
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2:
Suppose that an outcome has one player

maximizing behavior only if f2 > 0. Player 2

will choose f2 > 0 only if f1 > 0. Thus, both
f1 and f2 are greater than 0; but if the
material payoffs are small, this means that

the players must choose to maximize f1 and
f2, so that this must be a mutual-max outcome.

Suppose that player 1 is not maximizing
player 2's payoffs. Then he is not maximiz-

ing f1. If the payoffs are small, and given
that player 1 is not maximizing his own
payoffs, this implies that f2 < 0. This means,
as payoffs are small, that player 1 will mini-

does so, player 2 will in turn minimize player

it is inconsistent with utility maximization
for player i not to do so; therefore, this
outcome cannot be a fairness equilibrium.
The only outcomes consistent with fairness
equilibrium, therefore, are those for which

Now suppose that (a1, a2) is a Nash equilibrium, but one in which each player could
