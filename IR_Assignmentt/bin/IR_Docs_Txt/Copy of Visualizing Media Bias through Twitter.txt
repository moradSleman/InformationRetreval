bias of news media outlets in real-time from the way Twitter
users subscribe and disseminate news articles.
With the advent of social media services, news media outlets have started publishing on social networking sites. Likewise Internet users have moved from scanning traditional
mediums such as newspapers and television to using the Internet, in particular social networking sites, to ﬁnd news. In
the popular microblogging site Twitter, users actively follow a wide set of news sources, form interpersonal networks,
and propagate interesting news articles to their peers. These
media subscription and interaction patterns, which had previously been hidden behind media corporations, poses as a
new opportunity to understand media supply and consumption across society.
Social media provide an opportunity for researchers to examine how different sources report different angles on the
same event and how the news consumers react to that. Conducting a similar study on the traditional media would have
been difﬁcult, as it would have required extensive surveys to
gather the required data. By contrast, since all interactions
in social media are recorded online and are often made publicly accessible, gathering and aggregating data—processes
that are largely automated—can yield a view of an ideological separation of media sources (An et al. 2011).
In this work, we investigate a methodological issue: can
we draw a valid ideological map of news media based on
users’ subscription and interaction patterns. In order to answer this question, we focused on 24 major U.S. based news
outlets in Twitter and their aggregate 7 million followers.
We created a distance model based on the co-subscription
relationships and mapped the news media outlets along a
single dimensional dichotomous political spectrum. Based
on the distance measure, we also built a real-time Twitterbased application that visualizes an ideological map of various media sources.
Our data analysis revealed extreme polarization among
media sources, indicating that the political dichotomy naturally arises on Twitter in the media subscription patterns
of users. The political ideological map in user subscription
networks was strikingly similar to that proposed in previous
work (Milyo and Groseclose 2005), which assigned a ADA
(Americans for Democratic Action) score for each media
outlet by manually investigating the think-tank citations of
its news articles.

Abstract
Traditional media outlets are known to report political news
in a biased way, potentially affecting the political beliefs of
the audience and even altering their voting behaviors. Therefore, tracking bias in everyday news and building a platform
where people can receive balanced news information is important. We propose a model that maps the news media
sources along a dimensional dichotomous political spectrum
using the co-subscriptions relationships inferred by Twitter
links. By analyzing 7 million follow links, we show that the
political dichotomy naturally arises on Twitter when we only
consider direct media subscription. Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-time Twitter-based application that visualizes an
ideological map of various media sources.

Introduction
Media inﬂuence has been widely studied in cultivation theory, which holds that the popular media like newspapers
have power to inﬂuence people’s view of the world and set
their day-to-day norms. It is also well known that mainstream newspapers today have bias in selecting what to report and in choosing a slant on a particular report. Over
70 percent of Americans admit such bias (PewResearch
2004), and a number of studies have conﬁrmed that left
and right leaning news media consistently refer to different think-tanks in their stories (Milyo and Groseclose 2005;
Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010).
Exposure to biased news information have several important consequences. It may increase intolerance of dissent
and foster more ideological segregation of political and social issues (Glynn et al. 1999). Furthermore, it can affect the
political beliefs of the media audience and could ultimately
alter voting behavior (Vigna and Kaplan 2007). Therefore, tracking bias in everyday news and building a platform
where people can receive balanced news information are important. Unfortunately, existing studies on identifying media
bias have been restricted to examining a small set of news
outlets, due to challenges in gathering and analyzing a huge
amount of appropriate data (Milyo and Groseclose 2005;
Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010). As a step toward building
a such platform, we propose a novel model for inferring

the fraction of common audience. The intuition behind this
is the closer two media sources are the more their audiences
overlap. While this metric tells us about a relative distance
to other media source, it does not yield an actual distance of
two media sources given one dimensional space.
Let A represent the media of interest and
{B1 , B2 , · · · , Bn } be the set of n other media sources
for which we would like to measure the closeness from A.
Then, the closeness value of A and Bi is deﬁned as:
|A ∩ Bi |
(1)
c(A, Bi ) =
|A ∪ Bi |

The Twitter dataset
We obtained the Twitter data published in a previous
work (Cha et al. 2010), which comprises the following three types of information: proﬁles of 54M users,
1.9B directed follow links among these users, and all
1.7B public tweets that were ever posted by the collected
users. For the analysis, we identiﬁed a set of news media sources by consulting: (1) http://newspapers.com website, which listed top 100 news papers in the U.S. by
circulation; and (2) Twitter’s “Browse Interest” directory
at http://twitter.com/#!/who_to_follow/interests/news. From
these two lists, we searched news providers, including main
stream news outlets as well as individual journalists and anchors as it is also known that they have distinctive set of
audience and play a prominent role as news providers.
We only considered U.S. based news media sources, and
that left us with 24 media sources in news category. Those
media sources examined are listed in Table 1 with their political bias. We mapped the political leaning of media sources
into three groups, left-wing (liberal), center, and right-wing
(conservative), using a number of public data including a
seminal paper (Milyo and Groseclose 2005) and web resources such as http://www.left-right.us/about.html in order
to use them as a gold standard.

where k is a constant value determined based on the given
space S.
To predict a position of a media source on a given space,
we apply a global network positioning (GNP) algorithm (Ng
and Zhang 2002). GNP is a peer-to-peer and coordinatesbased approach that models the Internet as a geometric
space. It characterizes the position of any host in that space
with a set of geometric coordinates. In GNP, a small set
of hosts called Landmarks ﬁrstly compute their own coordinates in a chosen geometric space (e.g., a 1-dimensional
Euclidean space), then any remaining host computes its own
coordinates relative to the Landmarks. By considering a media source as a host, we are able to apply the GNP algorithm
to determine coordinates of media sources on 1-dimensional
Euclidean space.
Given the coordinates of the N Landmarks Li in the geometric space S, each media source now derives its own coordinates. To do so, a media source M measures the distances to those Landmarks Li with Eq.(2) (ideal media-toLandmark distances - d(M, Li )). By minimizing the overall
error between ideal d(M, Li ) and euclidean distances, M
can determine its own coordinates. For error measurement
function, we take the mean squared error (MSE).

Table 1: Political leaning of news media sources
Then we obtained all follow links to media sources and
corresponding tweets. The resulting dataset includes 24 media sources that have a total of 7,782,104 subscribers. Some
media sources were extremely popular and had millions
of followers like the New York Times (1,755,740) while
other media sources have fewer followers, e.g., NPR News
(116,834), Fox News (100,272), and U.S. News (4,747).
Among all subscribers of those 24 media sources, we only
considered active users for the analysis by ﬁltering out users
having less than 10 tweets for last three months.

Results
We implemented our proposed algorithm and developed a web-based application that visualizes a political spectrum of various media sources in Twitter at
http://bit.ly/mediaexplorer. As we mentioned before, our algorithm requires Landmarks and their coordinates. Rather
computing their coordinates in advance, we used a wellknown media bias measure, named ADA (Americans for
Democratic Action) score, which is calculated based on various quantities such as the number of times a media outlet
cites various think-tanks and other policy groups (Milyo and
Groseclose 2005).
The ADA score is scaled from 0 to 100, where 0 means
strongly conservative and 100, strongly liberal. For instance,
ADA scores are 39.7 for Fox News and 73.7 for NYTimes.

Generating an ideological map
We present a novel but preliminary algorithm that generates
an ideological map of media sources through Twitter network. The basic idea is to determine a position of one media
source on a one dimensional space by considering its distances to other media sources. The distance between them
may be inferred from their co-subscribers. Hence there are
two major parts in this algorithm; how to measure a distance
between two media sources and how to align them in a line.
We previously proposed a measure of closeness between
two media sources (An et al. 2011). There, we calculated

Our application uses the same scale with ADA score. Out of
18 news sources reported in (Milyo and Groseclose 2005),
we used four of them as Landmarks for our application; Fox
News (39.7), GMA(56.1), Today Show (64), and NPR News
(66.3), which are known to have not changed their political
leanings since their scores have reported.
The application shows the political coordinates of few
other media sources (e.g., NPR Politics, TIME, WSJ, TED
Chris, Chicago Tribunes) on the map depicted as green circles (Figure 1(a)). The blue circles on the map are those
four Landmarks. Note that an ideological map of any news
media sources can be generated automatically from our proposed methodology on inferring media bias while only 18
media sources have been examined in (Milyo and Groseclose 2005). Our application also shows, for a given media
outlet, the list for the most similar media outlets based on the
closeness measure. Figure 1(b) shows an example result we
obtained for New York Times, where NPR Politics, TIME,
and TED Chris come out as the top three closest media.
Finally, we test the effectiveness of our algorithm through
comparison between our predicted positions and that in
ADA’s list. Out of 18 news sources with ADA scores reported in (Milyo and Groseclose 2005), we found 10 of them
in our dataset. We used two of them as Landmarks of our
algorithm, Fox News (39.7) and Today Show (64), and positioned 8 media sources remained on a one dimensional space
scaled from 0 to 100. In the future, we will explore automatic ways of selecting the optimal (number of) Landmarks.
For now, we select those two media sources simply because
they belong to opposite sides of the political spectrum.
We measure how well ADA’s list and our algorithm’s list
(Figure 2) are correlated. To do so, we opt for two widelyused correlation measures: Spearman’s Rank Order correlation (rs ) and Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁ-

cient (rp ). We ﬁnd high correlations between the two lists:
correlation coefﬁcients are as high as .44 (p > 0.1) for rs and
.51 (p > 0.1) for rp (their statistical signiﬁcance is low simply because the number of media sources in the lists is low it is 8).

Related work
It is known that republicans and democrats read different
newspapers and books and geographically sort themselves
by choosing to live in completely different areas (Bishop
2008). Such media slant is important because it can change
people’s beliefs in, for example, who they should vote
for (Vigna and Kaplan 2007). Furthermore exposure to
biased information can result into negative societal consequences such as intolerance of dissent, political segregation,
and group polarization (Glynn et al. 1999).
Group polarization happens not only in the real world
but also online. Blogs reﬂecting different political views
rarely link to each other (Adamic and Glance 2005) and
online news consumption is biased, much like ofﬂine consumption (Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011). To date, several
studies have studied how people exchange political content in Twitter (Livne et al. 2011; Conover et al. 2011;
Yardi and danah boyd 2010). This work builds upon these
existing studies by extracting the overall media landscape
from user activities in Twitter.

Conclusion
We proposed a novel algorithm that generates a political dichotomy map of media sources on Twitter, which is based
on gathering online data and aggregating it via a closeness
measure. The ideological map of a particular issue can be
created in real time in conjunction with a public stream of
tweets from Twitter. Extending this work, we are currently
examining how news media sources of different political
slants cover the same news story by conducting topic classiﬁcation on news articles that are shared on Twitter.
Individuals might need to access to a pool of multiple
points of view against which they can contrast their own
values and belief as it helps them shape their eventual opinion. In the future, we hope to build a real-time platform that
helps people receive balanced news information based on
the model we proposed here. Nonetheless, we deemphasize
the potential beneﬁt of such political diversity because not
everyone prefers to receive diverse political opinions (Munson and Resnick 2010). Hence different strategies are required to assist heterogeneous individuals when news aggregators plan to increase opinion diversity.
