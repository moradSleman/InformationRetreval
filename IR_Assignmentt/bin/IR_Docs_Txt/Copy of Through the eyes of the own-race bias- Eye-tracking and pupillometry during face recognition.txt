and pupillometry during face recognition

People are generally better at remembering faces of their own race than faces of a different race, and this effect
is known as the own-race bias (ORB) effect. We used eye-tracking and pupillometry to investigate whether
Caucasian and Asian face stimuli elicited different-looking patterns in Caucasian participants in a face-memory
task. Consistent with the ORB effect, we found better recognition performance for own-race faces than other-race
faces, and shorter response times. In addition, at encoding, eye movements and pupillary responses to Asian faces
(i.e., the other race) were different from those to Caucasian faces (i.e., the own race). Processing of own-race
faces was characterized by more active scanning, with a larger number of shorter fixations, and more frequent
saccades. Moreover, pupillary diameters were larger when viewing other-race than own-race faces, suggesting a
greater cognitive effort when encoding other-race faces.

Keywords: Own-race bias; Eye-tracking; Pupillary response.

People tend to remember faces of their own race
better than faces of other, less familiar races, an
effect known as own-race bias (ORB). The ORB in
perception and memory is independent of the specific racial groups of either the participants or the
observed individuals (Brigham, Bennett, Meissner, &
Mitchell, 2007; Gross, 2009; Horry & Wright, 2008;
Wright, Boyd, & Tredoux, 2003). The effect is robust,
having been replicated in a variety of experimental techniques (Bothwell, Brigham, & Malpass, 1989;
Brigham & Ready, 1985; Darling, Martin, Hellmann,
& Memon, 2009; Eberhardt, 2005; Evans, Marcon, &
Meissner, 2009; Golby, Gabrieli, Chiao, & Eberhardt,
2001; Hirose & Hancock, 2007; Stahl, Wiese, &
Schweinberger, 2008). Furthermore, ORB is observed
at an early age and persists at different stages of
the human lifespan (Bar-Haim, Ziv, Lamy, & Hodes,
2006; Ferguson, Kulkofsky, Cashon, & Casasola,
2009; Goodman et al., 2007; Pezdek, Blandon-Gitlin,

& Moore, 2003; Sangrigoli & de Schonen, 2004),
although the precise age at which the classical ORB
is first observed remains uncertain (Goodman et al.,
2007).
Most theoretical accounts of the ORB are coined
in terms of face expertise, assuming that more frequent interaction with members of own ethnic groups
compared to other ethnic groups leads to richer and
more differentiated cognitive representations of faces
belonging to own ethnic groups (see reviews by
Meissner & Brigham, 2001; Sporer, 2001), leading
to more efficient and reliable recognition of ownrace faces than other-race faces. However, the relative
expertise in own-race face recognition is not simply
the result of differential exposure to faces, what Sporer
(2001) terms the “contact hypothesis,” as the ORB in
children and young adults is equally strong in persons
growing up in completely mixed, bi-ethnic environments and persons growing up in homogeneous ethnic

environments (Goodman et al., 2007). The growing
evidence for similar biases in face recognition among
other physical categories, such as age (Anastasi &
Rhodes, 2005; Kuefner, Macchi Cassia, Picoozzi, &
Briccola, 2008; Wright & Stroud, 2002) and gender
(Wright & Sladden, 2003), and among social categories (Bernstein, Young, & Hugenberg, 2007) further
suggests that ORB is not unique, but is an example
of a more general bias in social perception. According
to Sporer’s (2001) in-group/out-group theory, the relative expertise in face recognition develops as a result
of sustained selective attention to members of social
groups sharing one’s perceived physical and/or social
characteristics, and this expertise results in efficient,
automatic processing of in-group faces and less efficient, non-automatic processing of out-group faces
(Sporer, 2001; Tanaka, Kiefer, & Bukach, 2004).
The above model explains differences in the accuracy of own-race and other-race recognition and also
predicts that perception and recognition of other-race
faces are associated with greater attentional effort
and cognitive load compared to own-race faces. In
the present study of the ORB effect, we recorded
response times and accuracy of memory performance,
and used eye-tracking and pupillometry to study differences in face-processing strategies and to obtain an
estimate of the cognitive effort involved during the initial perception and subsequent recognition of novel
faces of individuals that belong to either one’s own
race (Caucasian) or to another race (Asian). Tracking
of eye movements during face perception provides
information about what features or regions of the
face are of interest to the viewer, and are critical to
face processing (Sæther, Belle, Laeng, Brennen, &
Øvervoll, 2009). Eye-tracking studies have revealed
sampling differences of faces in a variety of tasks.
Differences in gaze behavior have been found between
upright and inverted faces, famous and non-famous
faces, and morphed and non-morphed faces (Barton,
Radcliffe, Cherkasova, Edelman, & Intriligator, 2006),
and between faces that were processed either configurally or featurally (Schwarzer, Huber, & Dümmler,
2005). Interestingly, a study by Hills and Lewis (2011)
found that cueing (with a fixation cross) the lower part
of the face of “black” faces improved their later recognition over the recognition of “white” faces, whereas
cueing the upper part of the face reversed the advantage. This study indicates that fixations during encoding may be crucial for later memory and can modulate
the ORB effect. Few eye-tracking studies have examined the observers’ spontaneous gaze on faces in relation to the ORB effect. Among them, Meissner (2001)
observed higher fixation rates and greater distances
between fixations in own-race faces than other-race

203

faces during perception, a finding replicated in a recent
study by Goldinger, He, and Papesh (2009).
In the present study, besides expecting to replicate
the known ORB effect on recognition accuracy rates
(and related sensitivity, d , measures), we predicted,
on the basis of the automatic versus non-automatic
processing account (Sporer, 2001), that eye-tracking
measurements would reveal longer dwelling times in
fixation patterns for other-race than own-race faces,
larger pupillary response to other-race faces during
face encoding, and longer response times to other-race
faces in the memory test. A novelty of the present
study was that both eye fixation patterns and pupil size
variations were measured during encoding as well as
the subsequent recognition phase of own-race versus
other-race faces.
A previous study by Goldinger et al. (2009) has
revealed a larger pupillary response during the encoding of other-race faces in a directed memory task.
We believe that such a pupillary response provides an
index of the level of mental effort invested in processing own-race versus other-race faces (cf. Loewenfeld,
1999). Indeed, the measurement of pupil diameter variations over time has been used to investigate human
cognitive processes (Beatty, 1982; Goldwater, 1972;
Loewenfeld, 1999), in particular, cognitive load or
mental “effort” (Kahneman, 1973). In such tasks, the
size of the pupil is modulated by the level of cognitive activity (Hess & Polt, 1964; Kahneman & Beatty,
1966; Kahneman, Onuska, & Wolman, 1968; Peavler,
1974). Increased effort is also linked to increased
autonomic arousal (Bradley, Miccoli, Escrig, & Lang,
2007); in particular, an emotional state can activate
the sympathetic system, causing a constellation of
physiological changes that also include pupillary dilations. In sum, based on the hypothesis that there is a
less efficient, non-automatic processing of out-group
than in-group faces (Sporer, 2001), we predicted that
our participants would show larger pupillary dilations
when viewing Asian than Caucasian faces.
In relation to eye fixations, we also expected
that regions of the face that display the most salient
racial differences would attract overt attention and
that this would be expressed as longer dwell time in
these regions of interest (ROI) for the Asian than the
Caucasian faces. Intuitively, salient facial differences
between these ethnic groups can be found in the
architecture of the nose as well as the shape of the
eyes. However, recent work in plastic surgery has
also gathered precise anthropometric measurements
of several facial features (e.g., the nose, for the
purpose of rhinoplasty) in different ethnic groups
(since patients typically desire cosmetic enhancement
without sacrificing their ethnicity). Given that the set

204

WU, LAENG, MAGNUSSEN

of Asian faces used in the present study included faces
from Korean persons, it is interesting to note that some
studies have quantitatively analyzed differences of the
female Korean face from the female (North American)
Caucasian face (Choe et al., 2004) or, more specifically, the female Korean nose (Choe et al., 2006).
These studies have revealed the presence of highly
significant differences between Korean and Caucasian
female faces in nearly all of the traits measured (e.g.,
among 26 measurements of various facial traits of the
face—see Choe et al., 2004—only two traits failed to
show significant differences, the “tip protrusion” of
the nose and mouth width). More detailed measurements of the nose confirm that this structure differs
in a salient manner between Korean and Caucasian
female faces (Choe et al., 2006); specifically, Korean
women’s average nasal height was found to be greater,
while nasal length was smaller than the norm for
North American white women. Although the above
studies have focused on the female face, there is
reason to believe that comparisons between male
Asian and Caucasian faces would also show similar
differences. Therefore, based on the above findings,
we expected that the nose should particularly attract
gaze and more so for the Asian faces. In other words,
longer dwell times should be spent in the nasal region
for Asian than Caucasian faces.

METHOD
Stimuli
Image databases
Caucasian face images from the Karolinska
Directed Emotional Faces database (Lundqvist, Flykt,
& Öhman, 1998) were selected as own-race faces,
and Asian (Korean) face images from the Asian Face
Image Database PF01 (2001) were selected as otherrace faces. According to the population statistics of
Norway (Statistisk sentralbyrå, 2010), the majority
of the Norwegian population are ethnic Caucasian
Norwegians, with immigrants of East Asian background (e.g., from China, Japan, South Korea, and
Vietnam) accounting for about 0.5% of the population.
Given this small percentage, selecting Asian (Korean)
face images as other-race faces seemed highly suitable
for the present study, conducted in Oslo.
Image processing
The images consisted of full headshots of people
posing with neutral emotional expression against a

white background, with no obvious distinctive features
such as glasses, facial hair, or facial marks. To prepare
the images for the eye-tracking experiment, the images
were formatted to 8-bit grayscale, cropped and resized
to 395 × 455 pixels, using Adobe Photoshop (Version
CS3; Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).
In order to encourage eye movements over the face
pattern, faces (excluding hair and ears) subtended
an average visual angle of 6◦ horizontally and 8◦
vertically, which corresponds roughly to the size of a
face as it would be seen at a standard social distance
from the observer. Further, as we are interested in
monitoring pupillary changes caused by cognitive
processes, all the images were set to equal mean
luminance and apparent contrast in order to minimize
pupillary changes caused by differences in image
brightness (see Figure 1 for samples of images). The
luminance value of an image was calculated by the
mean values of all pixels (from 0 to 255), and apparent
contrast was calculated by dividing the standard
deviation by the mean of all pixels. All the images
were adjusted to the same target luminance value.
Fixation image
A fixation image (395 × 455 pixels) for baseline measurement was created, using Morpheus
Photo Morpher (Version 3.00; Morpheus Software)
by morphing four images: a Caucasian female, a
Caucasian male, an Asian female, and an Asian male.
Rasterization was applied to the morph by Adobe
Photoshop until it was not recognizable as a face, and
then adjusted to the same luminance and apparent contrast values as the other face images (see Figure 1 for
an example).
Pilot study
A pilot study was first carried out to select the face
images that would be used for the main experiment.
Participants were 20 Caucasian students from the psychology department at the University of Oslo, who
were paid 100 Norwegian kroner (NOK) each (approximately 18 US dollars). They were shown 114 of the
processed face images in random order, and subsequently they were asked to give estimates of the neutrality of emotional expression, age, and attractiveness
for each image.
Based on the obtained ratings, 64 images were
selected (16 images from each group of Caucasian
female, Caucasian male, Asian female, and Asian
male) such that there were no significant effects of
race, sex, or their interaction on the rated categories.

half of each randomized set. This procedure created
two different stimuli sequences.

Apparatus and environment
The experiment was carried out in a window-less room
illuminated by fluorescent lamps under normal indoor
lighting conditions, thus keeping the luminance level
of the room constant and ensuring that pupillary fluctuations were not caused by changes in the ambient
illumination.
Stimuli were presented on a 400 × 300 mm CRT
computer screen at a distance 900 mm away from
where participants were seated. The display screen’s
resolution was set at 1280 × 1024 pixels. The images
measured 395 × 455 pixels and were centered against
a white background during presentation.
Gaze positions and pupil diameter readings over
time were recorded at a sampling rate of 240 Hz,
by an infrared camera on an iView × Hi-Speed
monocular system built by SensoMotoric Instruments
(Teltow, Germany). The eye-tracking system uses the
“dark pupil technique,” with infrared illumination
and computer-based image processing to track the
pupil and the corneal reflection (i.e., the reflection
of the infrared light on the cornea) positions. Gaze
position was calculated from the relative positions of
the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection. Only
the left eye was tracked. Head movements during the
experiment were minimized with the help of chin and
forehead rests.
Figure 1. Examples of face stimuli: Two top rows show a male
and a female face for each ethnic group. The bottom image shows
the rasterized “fixation image” used as baseline.

This was confirmed by two-way unrelated ANOVAs
for each category, with race and sex as independent
variables.
For the main experiment, the selected 64 images
were further split into two groups, with the same number of images from each race and sex, such that there
was no effect of race or sex within each group for
each rated category. One group (32 images) was presented as the “study” set in the presentation phase, and
both groups (64 images) were presented in the “test”
set (i.e., together with the previous “study” set) in the
recognition phase.
For counterbalancing purposes, the images were
presented in a pseudo-randomized order. That is,
images for both the study and test sets were randomized separately, and it was ensured that no more
than three consecutive images of the same race or
sex would be shown. Subsequently, two sequences of
images were created by exchanging the first and last

Participants
Fifty-seven students (44 women) were recruited from
the University of Oslo, and were paid 100 NOK
each for their participation in the study. All participants were Caucasian, and had normal or correctedto-normal vision. Participants had a mean (SD) age of
25 (5.4) years.

Procedure
After participants arrived in the lab, they were briefed
about the study and were introduced to the eyetracking setup and procedure. This was followed by
signing the informed consent form. In order to foster incidental encoding, it was not revealed initially
that the study was about memory; instead, participants were told that this study was about face perception and debriefed at the end of the experiment.

The eye-tracking setup and seat were adjusted to a
comfortable position for each of the participants.
Eye calibration was performed at the start of
the presentation phase and the recognition phase.
Participants were asked to fixate at several points
sequentially on a 3 × 3 calibration map (1280 × 1024
pixels) on the presentation monitor. The purpose of eye
calibration is to map the locations of a person’s gaze
over a few fixed points on the presentation monitor
by recording the person’s pupil and corneal reflection
positions when looking at the calibration points. A successful calibration is critical to obtain accurate pupil
position readings. Participants were instructed to keep
as still as possible after calibration, to minimize drifts
caused by head movements.
Each experimental session consisted of three
phases: the presentation phase, the distractor phase,
and the recognition phase. The whole session lasted for
about an hour. During the presentation phase, upon the
successful completion of eye calibration, participants
were presented with the instructions. All the trials were
self-paced. First, a fixation cross was presented in the
center of the screen, and participants were told to look
at it and press a key only when they were ready to start.
After that, a fixation image was presented for 500 ms,
followed by a face image from the study set for 5000
ms, and then a blank screen for 100 ms. Recording of
eye data was timed precisely to be carried out only during the presentation of the fixation image and the face
image. At the end of each trial, participants were asked
to judge whether the face that was presented resembled either a “doctor” or a “lawyer.” The aim of this
task was to foster deep-level incidental encoding of the
stimuli, which would be more ecological to the acquisition of memories for faces in everyday life. Drift
correction was carried out every 10 trials to compensate for small head movements. After all the images
of the study set had been presented, participants were
re-presented with the nine-point calibration map and
were told to look at each point on the map for 1 s while
eye movements were recorded. This was later used for
data analysis to verify whether accurate eye calibration
had been maintained during the task. For the distractor
phase, participants were given 20 min to complete two
sets of mental rotation questions from the Vandenberg
and Kuse MRT test (1978).
During the recognition phase, eye calibration was
repeated, and only upon its successful completion was
the experiment continued. Again, all the trials were
self-paced and a fixation cross preceded a fixation
image that was presented for 500 ms, followed by a
face image from the test set for 5000 ms, and a blank
screen for 100 ms. Recording of eye data was carried
out during the presentation of the fixation image and

the face image. All images were presented without repetition in this phase, and participants indicated whether
the presented face image had been shown before in
the study phase by responding verbally either “old” or
“new” into a microphone. Upon the verbal response,
a microphone switch was triggered so that response
times were recorded. Thereafter, participants were told
to continue looking at the face, which would remain
on the screen for 5000 ms. Drift correction was carried
out every 10 trials. After all the images of the study
set had been presented, participants were presented
with a calibration map and were told to look at each
point on the map for 1 s while eye movements were
recorded.
At the end of the recognition phase, participants were debriefed, and given the compensation
for their participation. Questions regarding the experiment were also answered at this point. It was thus
verified that every participants did not have any previous experience with the face stimuli presented in this
study.

RESULTS
Analyses were performed on the behavioral data collected during the recognition phase and on pupil diameter and eye movement data in both the encoding and
subsequent recognition phase of the experiment. Three
participants were excluded from the analyses as they
were non-Caucasians. Another 11 participants were
excluded due to unstable pupil tracking or because
proper calibration was not maintained, thus leaving
43 participants for the following analyses. Preliminary
analyses revealed no significant effects between participants who were shown different sequences of the
same images; hence, subsequent analyses collapsed
data across these two groups.

Behavioral data
Signal detection calculations and response times were
used to analyze the results in the recognition phase
to verify that the ORB effect occurred. Two signal
detection measures, sensitivity (d´) and response bias
(C), were obtained for each participant separately for
responses to Caucasian and Asian images, based on the
formulae from Macmillan and Creelman (1991).
Participants demonstrated better recognition performance to own-race faces (as shown by higher
d´ values) than to other-race faces. Specifically, a
significant difference was observed between the d´
scores for Caucasian and Asian images (t = 8.49,

THE EYES OF THE OWN-RACE BIAS

df = 42, two-tailed p < .01), with higher d´ scores
observed for Caucasian images (M = 1.77) than for
Asian images (M = 0.97). Further, when deciding
whether they had seen a face before, participants
maintained a stricter response criterion for own-race
faces and a more liberal criterion for other-race faces,
although the extent of their response bias was small,
as the C values are small but differ significantly from
zero. Values for Caucasian images were significantly
positive (M = 0.19, t = 3.19, df = 42, p < .01),
and values for Asian images were significantly negative (M = – 0.13, t = –1.95, df = 42, p = .03).
Response times during recognition were faster for
Caucasian faces (M = 1557 ms) than for Asian
faces (M = 1600 ms) (t = 3.16, df = 42, two-tailed
p < .01). Thus, both the accuracy and response time
measures confirmed the ORB effect.

time window of 5000 ms after the onset of the face
image. The resulting pupillary change was used as
the dependent variable in the subsequent analyses, for
comparison with other trials. Thus, all reported values
of pupillary change in this study indicate an increase
in the pupil diameter size (in mm units) from the
baseline. Baseline pupil diameters averaged 3.45 mm,
with a 0.49-mm SD.
The results of the pupillary measures are shown in
Figure 2. Figure 2(a) illustrates the pupillary changes
over time during the presentation phase. The pupillary
change was smaller when encoding Caucasian compared to Asian faces (0.27 and 0.30 mm, respectively).
A t-test with Race as the paired variable confirmed
that the difference in the mean pupillary change values
was statistically significant (t = 2.29, df = 42, twotailed p = .027). The pupillary data from the study
phase were further analyzed with the response made
during the recognition phase. A repeated-measures
ANOVA with Race and Response (hits or misses)
as within-subject factors found no effects of Race,
F(1, 42) = 3.44, MSE = 7.54, p = .071; Response,
F(1, 42) = 2.67, MSE = 4.05, p = .140; or interactions, F(1, 42) = 1.67, MSE = 1.97, p = .204.
Pupillary data from the recognition phase were
analyzed by Race and the four possible Responses:
hits, misses, correct rejections, and false alarms.
A Race-by-Response ANOVA found no significant
effects of Race, F(1, 42) = 1.21, MSE = 3.09, p > .05,
or Race × Response interaction, F(3, 126) = 0.87,
MSE = 1.67, p > .05. There was an effect of Response,
F(3, 126) = 3.04, MSE = 8.00, p = .03, with
Bonferroni-corrected multiple comparisons revealing
a difference in pupillary data between hits and correct
rejections. Figure 2(b) shows the pupillary values over
time. The increase in pupil diameter is about twice the

Pupillary diameter
Separate pupil diameter readings were recorded when
the fixation and face images were shown, during
the presentation and recognition phases. Custom
scripts were written in Matlab (Version R2006a;
The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) for data
processing. The horizontal and vertical pupil diameter
data were first averaged; subsequently, artifacts such
as eye blinks and outliers (data points more than 2 SD
away from the mean of each trial) were replaced
by linearly interpolated values (7.1% of the data in
total). For each trial, a baseline was obtained from the
average pupil diameter over a time window of 500 ms
after the onset of the fixation image. The baseline
was then subtracted from the average of the stimulus
pupillary response of the same trial, recorded over a

increase during the encoding phase, consistent with an
increased cognitive load of memory retrieval.

Gaze patterns
The eye movement data were analyzed with BeGaze
(Version 2.3), a software developed specifically for
the analysis of eye-tracking data by SensoMotoric
Instruments (Teltow Germany). Figure 3(a) and (b)
show a typical scan path diagram and a focus map
of attention respectively, generated for a particular
Caucasian face stimulus. In this study, eye movements
were assigned by the software in the following way:
data points with velocities larger than a fixation velocity threshold and that lasted for more than 22 ms
were considered as saccade-like events, and the fixation velocity threshold was calculated from the first
peak-less velocities of the velocity stream. Saccadelike events were classified as true saccades if they
also contained a peak with velocity greater than 40◦ /s,
which lay in the 20–80% range of the data points. Eye
movements between two saccades were assigned as
fixations, and eye blinks constituted a special case of
fixations where data were not present.
Eye movements were analyzed on two levels: globally, that is, over the whole face image, analyzing the
global patterns of fixations and saccades, as well as
locally, analyzing the eye movement with respect to a
number of specific facial regions. For each face image,
seven ROI) were defined: eyes, nose, mouth, chin,
forehead, left cheek, and right cheek (see Figure 3(c)
for an example), and the analyses focused on the percentage of total time participants spent looking within
each ROI. Finally, we analyzed eye movements for
the reprocessing effect by comparing responses to old
and new images in the recognition phase. Below we

present the results for the encoding and recognitions
phases, separately.
Gaze patterns during encoding
During the encoding phase, indices of fixation
count, average fixation duration, saccade count, and
saccade amplitude over the whole image were collected. We observed a higher level of activity when
participants processed Caucasian faces compared to
Asian faces; specifically, participants fixated more frequently (t = 3.581, df = 42, two-tailed p < .01),
with shorter average duration (t = 2.284, df = 42,
two-tailed p = .027), and made more saccadic eye
movements (t = 2.355, df = 42, two-tailed p = .023)
when they were looking at own-race faces.1 However,
no significant effect of Race was observed for the distance traveled by the saccades (t = 0.226, df = 42,
two-tailed p > .05).
Indices of fixation count, average fixation duration,
saccade count, and saccade amplitude over the whole
image, collected during encoding, were also analyzed
by the responses made during subsequent recognition.
Separate two-way ANOVAs of Race and Response
(hits or misses) were conducted for each of the indices,
with mean values given in Table 1. Only Response had
an effect on fixation count, F(1, 42) = 4.65, MSE =
17.15, p = .037, with participants making more fixations for correct responses, that is, hits (M = 12.73),
than incorrect responses, that is, misses (M = 12.09).
Table 1 shows the mean values for each condition.

1 Note that these three variables are not independent. As the
recording time of each trial during presentation and recognition was
fixed at 5000 ms, a higher number of fixations would imply shorter
average fixation duration, and a higher number of saccades.

Within each ROI, the percentage of “dwell time”
was measured, calculated by the total duration of
fixations and saccades within the ROI as a percentage of the total duration of a trial (5000 ms). Three
main features accounted for the majority of the total
time participants viewed the faces: the eyes (50.7%),
the nose (16.9%), and the mouth (7.3%). To evaluate the presence of Race effects in the different ROIs,
paired-samples t-tests were conducted on the percentage dwell time during the conditions of own-race and
other-race face processing. The means of the percentage dwell times are plotted in Figure 4(a). Significant
Race effects were observed in the regions of the eyes,
the nose, and the forehead. In particular, our participants spent a significantly longer time looking at the
eyes (t = 2.284, df = 42, two-tailed p < .01) and forehead (t = 2.882, df = 42, two-tailed p < .01) of faces
of their own race, and a longer time looking at the nose
(t = 3.676, df = 42, two-tailed p < .01) of other-race
faces.
Further, a repeated-measures ANOVA of Race ×
recognition Response × ROI was conducted on percentage dwell times. An effect of ROI was found,
F(6, 42) = 130.62, MSE = 57969.20, p < .01,
and Bonferroni-corrected, multiple-comparison tests
revealed significant differences between the dwell time
on the eyes and all the other regions, the nose and
all the other regions, and the mouth and all the other
regions. An effect of interaction between Race and
ROI was also found, F(6, 42) = 7.39, MSE = 255.94,
p < .01, and post hoc tests on ROIs that were most
frequently fixated, that is, the eyes, nose and mouth,
found a significant difference between the dwell times
for “hit” responses on Caucasian and Asian faces in
the eyes region (t = 2.86, df = 42, two-tailed p < .01).
The means of the percentage dwell times are plotted in
Figure 4(b).
Heat maps and focus maps of attention were generated from the fixation data of all participants as
they processed own-race and other-race faces. For the
heat maps in Figure 5(a) and (b), red areas represent
locations at which participants looked the most, and
non-colored areas represent areas receiving the least

looking time. The attention maps of Figure 5(c) and
(d) show the areas most attended to as bright regions
and areas less attended to as dark regions. The maps
are overlaid on morphed images of all Caucasian and
Asian faces.

Gaze patterns during recognition
The analyses of eye movement on the whole face
during recognition were based on the four possible
Responses: hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection.
Measures of fixation count, average fixation duration,
saccade count, and saccade amplitude over the whole
image were collected and entered into 2 (Race) × 4
(Response) repeated-measures ANOVAs. No significant effects of Race or interactions involving Race
were observed. A significant effect of Response was
observed in fixation count, F(3, 126) = 3.19, MSE =
8.29, p = .026, with Bonferroni-corrected, multiple comparisons revealing differences between correct rejections and hits, correct rejections and misses,
false alarms and misses, and hits and misses. The
mean values for the different conditions are shown in
Table 2.
Next, the percentage dwell time on each ROI, calculated by the proportion of the total duration of fixations
and saccades occurring within a ROI within a trial (of
5000-ms duration), was measured and entered into a 2
(Race) × 4 (Response) × 7 (ROI) repeated-measures
ANOVA. A significant effect was found for ROI, F(6,
42) = 132.43, MSE = 94229.28, p < .01. Bonferronicorrected multiple comparisons revealed significant
differences between the percentage dwell time on the
eyes and all other regions, the nose and all other
regions, and the mouth and all other regions, as well
as the chin versus the right cheek.
Further, significant interactions were also observed
between ROI and Race, F(6, 42) = 17.02, MSE =
457.98, p < .01; between ROI and Response, F(18,
42) = 2.75, MSE = 75.75, p < .01; and between
Race, Response, and ROI, F(18, 42) = 1.62, MSE =
35.72, p = .05. Multiple comparisons revealed Race

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study confirm the classical
ORB effect, showing a better memory for own-race
faces than other-race faces. The signal detection analyses showed both a higher sensitivity (d´) and a stricter
response criterion to own-race faces in recognition
memory for Caucasian than Asian faces by Caucasian
participants. Further, participants spent longer times
on the old/new decisions for the Asian than the
Caucasian faces, suggesting a higher cognitive load
in the memory retrieval/decisions for other-race than
own-race faces. These differences are completely consistent with current theoretical accounts of the ORB
effect (see Sporer, 2001).
The conclusions from the behavioral results were
additionally supported by the recording of the pupillary responses and eye movements. First, the pupillary change during encoding of the faces differed
significantly for own-race and other-race faces, with

larger dilation observed for other-race faces than ownrace faces. This may reflect an increased cognitive
effort required for other-race faces and provides support for an automatic versus non-automatic processing
account of the ORB effect (Sporer, 2001); in other
words, own-race faces benefit from greater expertise
and efficiency in processing than other-race faces. This
result is also consistent with the findings of Goldinger
et al. (2009). However, a similar difference between
own- and other-race faces in pupillary response was
not observed in the recognition phase of the experiment. It is possible that during the recognition task
the pupillary response was mainly accounted for by
the effort of the recollection process, as testified by
the overall increase in pupillary diameters in this
condition.
Recording of eye movements showed a more active
scanning pattern during the encoding of own-race
faces than other-race faces; with a higher number
of saccades, and more frequent but shorter fixations.
Seven ROI were defined by outlining regions of the
faces corresponding to the eyes, nose, mouth, chin,
forehead, left cheek, and right cheek. Consistent with
what has been reported by Althoff and Cohen (1999),
participants looked at the eyes most of the time
(50.7%), followed by the nose (16.9%), and the mouth
(7.3%). Race differences on percentage dwell time
emerged for the eyes and nose regions during both

214

WU, LAENG, MAGNUSSEN

encoding and recognition, where it was observed that
participants spent a longer time looking at the eyes
of own-race faces and the nose of other-race faces.
Looking time was also longer for the forehead region
of own-race faces during encoding and for the left
cheek region of other-race faces during recognition;
however, the percentage dwell time on these regions
was generally quite low (less than 2%). These analyses revealed significant differences in the strategy of
visual processing of own-race and other-race faces,
both in the general scanning strategies and in several
of the ROIs. These findings are generally consistent
with the results of Goldinger et al. (2009), and the
global scanning recordings by Meissner (2001), except
that we did not observe greater distances between fixations in own-race faces than other-race faces, as was
reported in the previous studies. Obviously, the cognitive strategies in processing own-face versus other-race
faces differs in a consistent but subtle manner. The
higher eye movement activity level for own-race faces
indicates a more rapid, automatic processing of these
faces, sampling relevant information more quickly and
effortlessly, as is consistent with the pupillary response
data, and with the behavioral results.
In addition to the ORB effect, both gaze patterns
and pupillary response during recognition revealed
differences between old and new faces. For correct
responses, novel faces (i.e., correct rejections) evoked
a higher fixation count than old faces (i.e., hits),
whereas for incorrect responses, old faces (i.e., misses)
were more often fixated upon than new faces (i.e.,
false alarms), thus reflecting the eye-movement-based
memory effect (Henderson, Weeks, & Hollingworth,
1999; Vogt & Magnussen, 2007) shown by Althoff and
Cohen (1999) for face stimuli. In the present study, differences due to prior exposure to the stimuli were also
observed in specific regions of the face. In particular,
participants spent significantly more time looking at
the nose region in novel images than old images for
correct responses.
The memory effect was also observed for pupillary responses during recognition, in which response
to novel faces was weaker than response to previously seen faces in correctly answered trials. A similar
result was reported by Vo et al. (2008), who tested
old/new recognition of words, and found a significant effect of prior exposure characterized by larger
pupillary response to old stimuli, in an analysis of correctly classified trials. This effect is consistent with
increased pupillary sizes due to the greater cognitive
effort in confirming a recognition match than in discarding it. That is, recognition involves at least three
process components (Lamberts, Brockdorff, & Heit,
2002): (1) perceptual processing as an accumulation

of stimulus information, (2) retrieval from memory,
(3) an old-new decision-making process. We surmise
that the increased pupillary response reflected the full
engagement of the retrieval decision process by the
old items, which would, instead, be weakly engaged
by new items. Event Related Potential (ERP) studies
of recognition memory confirm that items correctly
judged as old are characterized by a greater positivity
than ERPs elicited by items correctly judged as new
(Rugg & Curran, 2007).
Further, eye data recorded during encoding
and recognition were analyzed as a function of
“hit”/“miss” behavioral responses made during recognition. During encoding, the fixation count was higher
in trials that eventually led to “hit” responses than to
“misses”; interestingly, this pattern was reversed during recognition, with higher fixation counts observed
for “misses,” than “hits.” This suggests that during
encoding, more frequent fixations can enhance the
quality of the memory and promote more accurate
retrieval later on, while, during retrieval, more fixations are made during inaccurate responses, an effect
that might indicate a more taxing decision-making
process.
To sum up, the results of the present study confirmed the behavioral ORB effect on both accuracy
and response times, and provided further support for
the notion that own-race and other-race faces are
processed by different cognitive strategies. The pattern of results is consistent with an automatic versus
non-automatic processing account of in-group and
out-group faces (Sporer, 2001).
