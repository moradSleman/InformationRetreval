Background and objectives: According to cognitive models, attentional biases in depression play key roles
in the onset and subsequent maintenance of the disorder. The present study examines the processing of
emotional facial expressions (happy, angry, and sad) in depressed and non-depressed adults.
Methods: Sixteen unmedicated patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 34 never-depressed
controls (ND) completed an eye-tracking task to assess different components of visual attention (orienting attention and maintenance of attention) in the processing of emotional faces.
Results: Compared to ND, participants with MDD showed a negative attentional bias in attentional
maintenance indices (i.e. ﬁrst ﬁxation duration and total ﬁxation time) for sad faces. This attentional bias
was positively associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the MDD group spent
a marginally less amount of time viewing happy faces compared with the ND group. No differences were
found between the groups with respect to angry faces and orienting attention indices.
Limitations: The current study is limited by its cross-sectional design.
Conclusions: These results support the notion that attentional biases in depression are speciﬁc to
depression-related information and that they operate in later stages in the deployment of attention.

1. Introduction
According to cognitive models (Beck, 1967, 1976; Bower, 1981),
biases in the processing of emotional information have a crucial
role in the onset and maintenance of depressive symptoms. These
theories predict that depressed individuals can be characterized as
displaying negative biases in all aspects of information processing,
including interpretation, memory, and attention.
Depressed individuals have been found to have attentional
biases in some cognitive reaction-time tasks; however, evidence for
this negative bias is mixed (Mogg & Bradley, 2005). In the
emotional Stroop color-naming task, researchers have observed an
increase in the interference by negative words in individuals with
depression. However, this interference was only found in conditions when relatively long stimuli exposure durations of 1 s or more
were used (Gotlib & Cane, 1987; Segal, Gemar, Truchon, Guirguis, &
Horowitz, 1995). Studies in which words were presented for shorter
durations have typically obtained null ﬁndings (Bradley, Mogg,

Millar, & White, 1995; Mogg, Bradley, Williams, & Mathews,
1993). Similar results have been found with the dot-probe task.
For example, Donaldson, Lam, and Mathews (2007) presented 72
pairs of words (36 words each at 500 ms and 1000 ms durations) to
a sample of depressed patients. They found that individuals with
clinical depression were faster than non-depressed controls in
detecting dot-probes that appeared in the same location as a
negative word when it was presented for 1000 ms. Both groups
were observed to equally attend to stimuli presented for 500 ms
durations. Given this pattern of ﬁndings, some authors have suggested that depression is characterized by elaborative, rather than
automatic processing, in contrast to anxiety disorders (Mogg &
Bradley, 2005). According to this notion, Teachman, Joormann,
Steinman, and Gotlib (2012) have concluded that attentional biases in depression are conscious and intentional, while those
observed in anxiety disorders are unconscious and unintentional.
In accordance with this view, other researchers have proposed that
depressed individuals may not necessarily be quicker at directing
their attention to negative information than control participants,
but that once negative stimuli capture their attention they experience difﬁculties disengaging their focus (Gotlib & Joormann,
2010). Unfortunately, the reaction time tasks used in these
studies are not able to directly assess whether the attentional

108

biases in depression are located in the orienting components presumed to be more automatic or the maintenance components
presumed to be more elaborative.
In addition to the duration of stimulus presentation, studies that
used more ecological stimuli such as images or scenes instead of
words were more likely to ﬁnd a negative attentional bias in
depression. This phenomenon has been attributed to the fact that,
in general, pictures are able to convey more affective information
than words (Glaser & Glaser, 1989). The majority of studies have
used images of emotional facial expressions. Gotlib, Kasch, et al.
(2004) found that, compared to healthy individuals, clinically
depressed participants showed an attentional bias to sad faces.
Similar results have been obtained in other studies using facial
expressions (Fritzsche et al., 2010; Gotlib, Krasnoperova, Neubauer,
& Joormann, 2004; Joormann & Gotlib, 2007). It is also important to
note that, with some exceptions (Leyman, De Raedt, Schacht, &
zquez, Marker, Lemoult, & Joormann,
Koster, 2007; S
anchez, Va
2013), this negative attentional bias in depression tends to be
speciﬁc to depression-related information and not to other types of
negative stimuli, such as threatening cues (Gotlib, Kasch, et al.,
2004; Gotlib, Krasnoperova, et al., 2004; Hankin, Gibb, Abela, &
Flory, 2010). Oehlberg, Revelle, and Mineka (2012) recently
demonstrated that attentional biases to dysphoric information
appeared to only relate to depressive symptoms, while biases to
anxiety-related information were associated with overall negative
affect.
Additionally to greater attentional processing of negative stimuli, some studies have shown the absence of a “protective bias” in
depressed participants. This bias is characterized by an attentional
preference for positive information and is typically present in nondepressed individuals (McCabe & Gotlib, 1995; Shane & Peterson,
2007). The absence of a protective bias has been interpreted as
evidence of insensitivity to reward, such that rewarding stimuli fail
to capture attention (Armstrong & Olatunji, 2012). Reduced attention to positive stimuli could be related to deﬁcits in positive affect,
a factor that appears speciﬁc to depressive disorders (Clark &
Watson, 1991; Watson & Naragon-Gainey, 2010).
The majority of studies that have already been discussed used
response latency tasks, which assess attentional bias indirectly and
do not differentiate between the different components of attention
(e.g. orienting attention versus maintenance of attention; Yiend &
Mathews, 2005). Moreover, they do not account for the possibility that attentional biases may be confounded by motor retardation
in depressed individuals (Mathews, Ridgeway, & Williamson, 1996).
To overcome these limitations, researchers interested in selective
attention processes have turned to eye movement recording tasks
because they provide a relatively continuous and direct measure of
deployment of attention. The recent meta-analysis conducted by
Armstrong and Olatunji (2012) reviews the existing eye-tracking
research on depression and anxiety. In their review they included
nine eye-tracking studies with depressed participants but only two
of them were conducted with clinical samples. Results from these
studies have revealed that analogue participants maintain longer
gazes with negative stimuli (Caseras, Garner, Bradley, & Mogg,
2007; Leyman, De Raedt, Vaeyens, & Phillipaerts, 2011) and
shorter gazes with positive ones (Ellis, Beevers, & Wells, 2011;
Sears, Thomas, LeHuquet, & Johnson, 2010) compared with control participants. However, orienting biases to negative information
have yet to be found, except by Sears, Newman, Ference, and
Thomas (2011) who found a bias in the initial orientation to
depression-related images.
Regarding the studies conducted with clinically depressed participants, the results are not conclusive because the two existing
studies use very different experimental methodologies. Kellough,
Beevers, Ellis, and Wells (2008) designed a 2  2 matrix with

dysphoric, aversive, positive, and neutral images. These authors
found that depressed participants spent more time viewing
dysphoric images relative to positive, aversive, and neutral ones in
comparison to healthy controls. No orienting biases to negative
information were found. On the other hand, Mogg, Millar, and
Bradley (2000) designed an attentional task with pairs of images
comprising an emotional and a neutral facial expression that were
displayed for a relatively short period (i.e., 1000 ms). In this study,
orienting components of attention were assessed (i.e., initial
orientation and latency for the ﬁrst orientation), but maintenance
components were not. The data revealed that clinically depressed
patients did not show orienting biases to negative information.
Despite these initial ﬁndings, further research using eyetracking technology is necessary to clarify the role of attentional
biases in depression. To better elucidate the mechanisms underlying attentional biases in depression, our study improved several
methodological domains found in current literature. Firstly, our
research builds upon existing literature by including participants
with clinical depression rather than analogue samples. Secondly,
unlike in earlier studies, we included in the same design orienting
and maintenance measures to assess both components of attentional biases simultaneously. Another improvement of our study
over previous research is that we included two different parameters to assess orienting and maintenance components. More speciﬁcally, we assessed orienting response by direction and latency of
initial gaze, similar to Mogg et al. (2000), whereas we measured
maintenance response by duration of the ﬁrst ﬁxation and total
ﬁxation time (see procedure below). Also, to enhance the detection
of maintenance components (Gotlib & Joormann, 2010) we used a
relatively long exposure time for the stimuli (i.e., 3000 ms).
Therefore, the current study was designed to assess the different
components of visual attention in depressed and non-depressed
participants when presented with negative, positive, and neutral
facial expressions in a free viewing paradigm. The advantage of
using emotional faces is that they are more likely to be ecologically
valid than words (Gross, 2005) and are better at attracting attention
due to their higher interpersonal relevance. Based on previous
studies of eye movement (Eizenman et al., 2003; Kellough et al.,
2008) and reaction time tasks (Gotlib, Kasch, et al., 2004; Gotlib,
Krasnoperova, et al., 2004), we hypothesized that depressed participants would show a negative bias in the maintenance of gaze
speciﬁcally with regards to sad facial expressions (i.e. duration of
the ﬁrst ﬁxation and total ﬁxation time) but not in the orientation
of gaze (i.e. direction and latency of initial gaze). With respect to
happy expressions, our second hypothesis was that the depressed
group would show an absence of positive bias in comparison with
the control group in the maintenance of gaze indices (Ellis et al.,
2011). Finally, in accordance with Oehlberg et al. (2012), we hypothesized that the severity of depression would be related speciﬁcally to the magnitude of attentional biases to sad facial
expressions but not angry ones.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
A sample of 16 participants diagnosed with current MDD and 34
never-depressed controls (ND) took part in the study. Depressed
patients were recruited from an outpatient university psychology
clinic before therapy had begun. Trained interviewers administered
the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSMeIV (SCID; First,
Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1996) to patients during their ﬁrst
session in the study and those with a primary diagnosis of MDD
were included in the depressed group. Individuals with current or
lifetime diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, psychotic symptoms, and

zquez / J. Behav. Ther. & Exp. Psychiat. 46 (2015) 107e114
A. Duque, C. Va

those who abused alcohol or other substances within the past 6
months were excluded. The ND group consisted of individuals who
did not have a current diagnosis or past history of any Axis I disorder according to the SCID. All participants were between the ages
of 18 and 55 and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All
individuals were required to refrain from taking any psychotropic
medication at the time of the study.

109

sad expressions were 5.53 (SD ¼ .39), 5.39 (SD ¼ .52), and 5.32
(SD ¼ .62), respectively. Mean intensity scores were 5.55 (SD ¼ .51),
5.86 (SD ¼ .58), and 5.76 (SD ¼ .94), respectively.

Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II;
Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), a 21-item self-report measure of
depression. Each item was rated on a Likert scale with four possible
answer choices increasing in intensity from 0 to 3 to yield a total
BDI-II score that ranged from 0 to 63. This measure has shown
excellent reliability and validity (Beck et al., 1996). In the current
study, the internal consistency of the BDI-II was very good (a ¼ .93).

2.3.2. Apparatus
Eye location and visual gaze were assessed with a Tobii tx-120
infrared eye-tracker system that allowed for recording at a frequency of 60 Hz (coordinates were sampled every 16.7 ms). Head
position was kept stable with the use of an anatomic chair. Participants' eyes were kept at a distance of 60 cm from the eye-tracker
and 73 cm from the screen. A ﬁve-point calibration was performed
before each recording session. Eye movements that lasted for a
minimum of 100 ms within a 1 visual angle were classiﬁed as a
ﬁxation. Tobii Studio software (2.0.6) was used for stimuli presentation and collection of visual ﬁxation data. Two areas of interest
were identiﬁed for each trial that corresponded with the total area
for the emotional face and the neutral face.

2.4. Procedure

2.3.1. Materials
Stimuli consisted of pairs of images that were comprised of an
emotional and a neutral facial expression made by the same person
(see Fig. 1). A set of 28 faces (14 men and 14 women), each
expressing happy, angry, sad, and neutral emotions, were selected
from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) database
€
(Lundqvist, Flykt, & Ohman,
1998). Original KDEF frontal view
pictures were framed with an oval window to remove noninformative aspects of the faces such as the hair and neck. This
editing procedure has been used in previous studies (Calvo &
Lundqvist, 2008; Williams, Moss, Bradshaw, & Mattingley, 2005).
Image selection was based on data from a previous validation study
nchez & Va
zquez, 2013), which
of KDEF emotional pictures (Sa
measured emotional prototypicality of the faces for each corresponding emotion, and their emotional intensity (Schaefer, Nils,
Sanchez, & Philippot, 2010). Speciﬁcally, prototypicality and intensity of each emotional face were measured by two independent
0e10 Likert scales, where 0 indicated “Not at all”, 5 “Some” and 10
“Extremely”. Analyses showed that the three types of emotional
faces did not differ signiﬁcantly in prototypicality, F (2, 81) ¼ 1.21,
n.s., h2 ¼ .029 or in their intensity, F (2, 81) ¼ 1.39, n.s., h2 ¼ .03. The
mean scores for emotional prototypicality for the happy, angry, and

After signing informed consent, the SCID was administered at
the ﬁrst study visit. Selected participants returned one week later
to take part in the experimental session. This two-session procedure is often used to minimize fatigue effects in clinically depressed
participants (Gotlib, Kasch, et al., 2004; Gotlib, Krasnoperova, et al.,
2004; Joormann & Gotlib, 2007). The attention task was administered upon completion of the BDI-II.
The free viewing task was comprised of 84 trials (28 images each
of happy, angry, and sad expressions paired with the corresponding
neutral expression by the same actor or actress) which were displayed on a 53 cm (width)  30 cm (height) screen. Emotional and
neutral expressions were presented equally as often on the left as on
the right side of the screen. The display size of each facial expression
was 9.5 cm (width)  12 cm (height). Participants were seated in an
anatomic chair at a distance of 73 cm from the screen, representing a
horizontal visual angle of 14 between the two pictures.
Each trial began with presentation of a black screen for 500 ms,
which was followed by the display of a white ﬁxation cross in the
middle of the screen for another 500 ms. Immediately after, a
random 1-digit number (also in white) replaced the ﬁxation cross
for a duration of 1000 ms. Participants were instructed to ﬁxate on
the number and to verbalize it as quickly as possible to ensure that

central ﬁxation was being performed (Calvo & Avero, 2005). A pair
of faces was then displayed on the screen for 3500 ms. Participants
were instructed to view the images naturally, with no further
requirements.
2.5. Dependent variables
Using gaze data collected by the eye-tracker system, four
attentional indices were extracted for the present study:

variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test our ﬁrst and second hypotheses to investigate whether clinically depressed patients
differed from never-depressed individuals in the attentional processing of emotional information. Bonferroni follow-up tests were
used to further analyze signiﬁcant differences.
A series of zero-order correlation analyses was conducted to
explore the relationships between attentional bias indices and
depressive symptoms in order to test our third hypothesis.
3. Results

a) Direction of initial gaze (i.e. location of the ﬁrst ﬁxation,
either on the emotional or neutral facial expression, in each
trial).
b) First ﬁxation latency (i.e. time elapsed until the ﬁrst ﬁxation
occurs on each type of facial expression in each trial).
c) First ﬁxation duration (i.e. duration of the ﬁrst ﬁxation made
on each type of facial expression in each trial).
d) Total ﬁxation time (i.e. total time that each subject ﬁxates on
each type of facial expression in each trial).

3.1. Group characteristics
As shown in Table 1, participants in the depressed group reported signiﬁcantly greater symptoms of depression than those in
the control group, t (18.11) ¼ 4.92, p < .001. Groups did not differ in
age, t (48) ¼ .11, p ¼ .91, gender ratio, X2 (1, n ¼ 50) ¼ 1.24, p ¼ .27,
education level, X2 (1, n ¼ 50) ¼ .04, p ¼ .83, or marital status, X2 (2,
n ¼ 50) ¼ .54, p ¼ .76.
3.2. Attentional processing of emotional information

2.5.1. Bias scores
Shane and Peterson (2007) asserted that relative bias scores
might be more relevant indicators of depression-associated processing of emotional information than absolute indices comparing
emotional with neutral information. Following this guideline,
relative bias scores were computed for each attentional index
associated with each emotional category. For direction of initial
gaze, we calculated the percentage of trials in which a subject
ﬁxated ﬁrst on the emotional face rather than the neutral one.
Scores greater than 50% were taken to indicate a bias towards the
emotional expression, whereas scores lower than 50% indicated a
preference for neutral ones. With regards to latency, ﬁrst ﬁxation
duration, and total ﬁxation time, we calculated bias scores by
subtracting the corresponding value obtained for the neutral
expression from the corresponding value obtained for the
emotional expression. Score indices based on differences such as
nchez, &
these have been employed in previous research (Duque, Sa
V
azquez, 2014). Scores greater than zero were interpreted as a bias
towards emotional expressions whereas those lower than zero
indicated a preference for neutral ones.

Eye movement data were initially processed using Tobii Studio
Software (2.0.6). Only participants with high quality recordings
(>70%) were included in data analysis. Trials with missing data
were removed from analyses. The MDD and ND groups did not
differ in the number of trials removed, t (48) ¼ .78, p ¼ .44.
Outlier analysis was conducted using Cook's distance. Cases
with values larger than 1 are considered to possibly bias the results
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). In our sample, the maximum value for
Cook's distance was .29, suggesting no major outlier bias.
3.2.1. Direction of initial gaze
A 2 (Group: MDD, ND)  3 (Emotional category: happy, angry,
sad) mixed-model ANOVA was conducted to explore the location of
the ﬁrst ﬁxation in each trial. Analyses showed a non-signiﬁcant
group  emotion interaction, F (2, 96) ¼ .37, p ¼ .69, h2 ¼ .008,
and a non-signiﬁcant main effect for group, F (1, 48) ¼ .39, p ¼ .53,
h2 ¼ .008. There was a signiﬁcant main effect of emotional category,
F (2, 96) ¼ 7.41, p ¼ .001, h2 ¼ .13, which revealed a greater initial
tendency to ﬁxate on happy faces than on those with angry
(p ¼ .03) and sad (p ¼ .001) expressions. To explore this attentional
pattern in more detail, we compared each bias score with a value of
50% (no bias). Analyses showed that bias scores for happy, t
(49) ¼ 5.62, p < .001, angry, t (49) ¼ 2.51, p ¼ .01, and sad, t
(49) ¼ 2.20, p ¼ .03, faces were statistically different from the nobias criterion. Mean scores were 58.76% (SD ¼ 11.03), 53.02%
(SD ¼ 8.51), and 52.32% (SD ¼ 7.45), respectively. These results
indicate that initially, participants tended to ﬁxate more frequently
on the emotional expression than on the neutral one in each
emotional category. This bias was especially true for happy faces. Of
note, one characteristic of this task is that emotional faces (for each
emotional category) and neutral faces appeared in a ratio of 1:3.
Therefore, it is possible that the salience of emotional stimuli may
have contributed to the participant's observed tendency to direct
the initial gaze more frequently to emotional rather than to neutral
faces.
3.2.2. First ﬁxation latency
A 2 (Group: MDD, ND)  3 (Emotional category: happy, angry,
sad) mixed-model ANOVA showed a non-signiﬁcant interaction
between emotional category and group, F (2, 47) ¼ .01, p ¼ .98,
h2 ¼ .001, a non-signiﬁcant main effect for group, F (1, 48) ¼ 1.88,
p ¼ .17, h2 ¼ .04, and a signiﬁcant main effect for emotional category, F (2, 47) ¼ 13.16, p < .001, h2 ¼ .36. Follow-up comparisons

group  emotional category interaction, F (2, 96) ¼ 3.50, p ¼ .03,

h2 ¼ .07. Post-hoc analyses indicated that, compared with the ND

group, participants with MDD had signiﬁcantly longer ﬁrst ﬁxation
durations on sad faces (p ¼ .05). No differences were found for
happy (p ¼ .25) and angry expressions (p ¼ .28) e see Fig. 2.
Attentional bias scores to sad faces were compared with a no-bias
criterion (zero) for each group in order to reveal whether differences between the MDD and ND groups were attributable to a bias
in either one or both of the groups. These analyses showed that
participants in the MDD group had an attentional bias which was
characterized by longer ﬁrst ﬁxation duration on sad facial expressions, t (15) ¼ 3.00, p ¼ .01, whereas ND participants did not
show any attentional bias, t (33) ¼ .17, p ¼ .86.

Fig. 2. Bias scores of ﬁrst ﬁxation time for happy, angry, and sad faces. Participants

lower than zero indicate a preference toward neutral faces. Error bars represent
standard error.

revealed that participants ﬁxated faster on happy faces than on
those with angry (p ¼ .02) and sad (p < .001) expressions. Comparisons with a no-bias criterion (zero) indicated that participants
ﬁxated faster on emotional, rather than neutral facial expressions in
the happy, t (49) ¼ 6.11, p < .001, angry, t (49) ¼ 3.94, p < .001,
and sad, t (49) ¼ 2.89, p ¼ .01 categories. This bias was also
observed to be greater for happy faces. As noted above, these
ﬁndings are limited by the low ratio of emotional faces in each
category, which may have contributed to the observed tendency of
participants to ﬁxate faster on emotional than on neutral faces.
3.2.3. First ﬁxation duration
A 2 (Group: MDD, ND)  3 (Emotional category: happy, angry,
sad) mixed-model ANOVA examined whether MDD and ND groups
differed in the ﬁrst ﬁxation duration in each emotional category.
Analyses showed a non-signiﬁcant effect for emotional category, F
(2, 96) ¼ 2.02, p ¼ .14, h2 ¼ .04, and a non-signiﬁcant main effect for
group, F (1, 48) ¼ .93, p ¼ .34, h2 ¼ .02. There was a signiﬁcant

3.2.4. Total ﬁxation time
A 2 (Group: MDD, ND)  3 (Emotional category: happy, angry,
sad) mixed-model ANOVA was conducted to examine whether
MDD and ND groups differed in the total ﬁxation time in each
emotional category. Analyses showed a non-signiﬁcant main effect
for group, F (1, 48) ¼ 1.34, p ¼ .25, h2 ¼ .03, and a signiﬁcant main
effect for emotional category, F (2, 47) ¼ 4.08, p ¼ .02, h2 ¼ .15. This
main effect was qualiﬁed by a signiﬁcant group  emotional category interaction, F (2, 47) ¼ 3.24, p ¼ .04, h2 ¼ .12. Post-hoc analyses
indicated that patients with MDD spent signiﬁcantly more time
viewing sad faces than those in the ND group (p ¼ .04) e see Fig. 3.
The MDD group also spent marginally less time viewing happy
faces compared to the ND group (p ¼ .06). No differences were
found with respects to angry faces (p ¼ .13) Attentional bias scores
for sad and happy facial expressions were compared with a no-bias
criterion (zero) for each group in order to clarify whether differences between MDD and ND groups were due to a bias in either one
or both of the groups. Analyses showed that participants with MDD
had an attentional bias to sad faces which was characterized by
longer total ﬁxation times, t (15) ¼ 2.19, p ¼ .04, whereas ND participants did not show this bias, t (33) ¼ 1.11, p ¼ .27. Rather, the
ND group was shown to have an attentional bias to happy faces, t
(33) ¼ 5.41, p < .001. The MDD group also showed this bias, t
(15) ¼ 2.22, p ¼ .04; however, as noted above, it was marginally
greater for the ND group.
3.3. Relationships between attentional indices and depressive
symptoms
A series of bivariate correlation analyses was conducted to
explore whether attentional bias scores were associated with
severity of depressive symptoms. Table 2 shows the zero-order

relationship: symptoms of depression were positively associated
with the total time that participants ﬁxated on sad facial expressions. The remaining associations were not found to be signiﬁcant.
4. Discussion
The current study examined the attentional processing of
emotional information, speciﬁcally with regards to emotional facial
expressions in depression. We also investigated the relationship
between the magnitude of attentional biases to emotional information and the severity of depressive symptoms. The present study
included clinically depressed patients and never depressed participants. Furthermore, in order to increase the reliability of the
results, we analyzed all measures of orienting and maintenance
biases using two different indices for each one.
In our ﬁrst hypothesis, we predicted that participants with MDD
would show a speciﬁc negative attentional bias to sad faces in the
maintenance of gaze, but not in the orienting of gaze, compared with
those in the ND group. The results conﬁrmed the ﬁrst hypothesis:
clinically depressed participants demonstrated longer ﬁrst ﬁxation
duration and greater total ﬁxation time on sad facial expressions.
However, no group differences were found in the orienting indices
(i.e. the direction of initial gaze and ﬁrst ﬁxation latency). These
results are consistent with ﬁndings from previous studies that have
found that attentional bias to negative information in depressed
individuals is mostly present in the later stages of deployment of
attention (Gotlib, Krasnoperova, et al., 2004; Kellough et al., 2008).
Furthermore, such ﬁndings support the idea that although depression is not characterized by an initial orienting bias toward negative
information, individuals with depression have greater difﬁculties in
disengaging their attention from negative information once it is in
their attentional focus (Bradley, Mogg, & Lee, 1997).
Problems with inhibiting attention to negative stimuli in MDD
have been linked to an ineffective use of mood regulation strategies
which contributes to the maintenance of negative affect (Joormann
& D'Avanzato, 2010). It should be noted that in our study, attentional biases to negative information were found only toward
stimuli related to depression (i.e. sad faces) and not to other kinds
of negative information (i.e. angry faces). These results are consistent with other studies that, not using eye-tracking methods, have
shown a speciﬁc attentional bias to sad, but not angry or threatening, facial expressions in clinically depressed samples (Gotlib,
Kasch, et al., 2004; Hankin et al., 2010).
Our second hypothesis with regards to the processing of positive
information (i.e. happy faces) was partially supported. Although
participants in the MDD group spent less total time viewing faces
with happy emotional expressions than ND participants, this effect
was found to only reach marginal signiﬁcance. The greater proportion of negative (sad and angry) than positive stimuli (happy)
may have made happy faces more salient for both groups. Thus, it is
possible that the observed differences between both groups in the
total ﬁxation time to positive stimuli would have been greater
without a saliency effect. Nevertheless, this trend is consistent with
other eye-tracking studies that have found a robust bias toward
happy faces in healthy participants using similar attentional indices
nchez & Va
zquez, 2014). No group differences
(Ellis et al., 2011; Sa
were found however, in the duration of the ﬁrst ﬁxation to happy
faces. Collectively, these results suggest that attentional bias to
positive information in healthy individuals could be explained by
greater processing of happy facial expressions across trials rather
than by initial engagement as assessed by ﬁrst ﬁxation (Kellough
et al., 2008). Although no speciﬁc prediction was made on orienting indices to happy faces, no differences were found in the direction of initial gaze and ﬁrst ﬁxation latency.

Attentional deployment to emotional information is considered
to play a key role in emotional regulation (Gross, 1998). Attentional
deployment is an antecedent-focused regulatory strategy; therefore, it occurs before an emotional response can be fully generated.
According to this idea, it could be hypothesized that attending to
positive or negative stimuli would improve or worsen an individual's emotional state, respectively. In fact, some preliminary
research has shown that difﬁculty in disengaging focus from
negative facial expressions predicts slower recovery from a
negative-mood induction procedure in depressed patients
nchez et al., 2013). In our study, the trend observed in the ND
(Sa
group to ﬁxate on happy faces versus the MDD group could be
interpreted as a cognitive mechanism through which mood is
regulated. Interestingly, a previous study has shown, in a
nonclinical sample of participants, that an increased focus on
happy faces after a negative mood induction is associated to an
nchez, V
 mez, & Joormann,
enhanced mood recovery (Sa
azquez, Go
2014). Therefore, these overall results suggest that attentional
processing of positive information may play a relevant role as a
mood repair mechanism.
It is possible that the attentional pattern observed in healthy
individuals operates as a protective bias to facilitate or regulate
mood in a positive way and to maintain positive emotional balance
nchez and
(McCabe, Gotlib, & Martin, 2000). Along a similar vein, Sa
zquez (2014) found a preference for happy facial expressions in a
Va
sample of university students, suggesting the presence of greater
processing of positive information in the general population. This
bias toward positive stimuli was also associated with greater life
satisfaction and positive emotions. In contrast, the attentional
biases (i.e. greater processing of negative stimuli and reduced
processing of positive stimuli) observed in our sample of depressed
participants may contribute to the exacerbation and maintenance
of symptoms of depression.
Over the last few years, Cognitive Bias Modiﬁcation paradigms,
particularly those intended to modify attentional biases, have been
implemented to promote better emotional regulation through
attentional deployment training. For example, Wells and Beevers
(2010) observed that repeatedly training attention away from
dysphoric stimuli lead to a reduction in symptoms of depression
over time. Similarly, Baert, De Raedt, Schacht, and Koster (2010)
found that training attention toward positive stimuli alleviated
symptom severity in students experiencing mild depressive
symptoms. Although further research is necessary to conﬁrm the
efﬁcacy of these paradigms in emotional regulation, initial ﬁndings
suggest that attentional biases to emotional information, such as
the ones shown in our sample of clinically depressed participants,
are a relevant feature of information processing in depression.
Our third hypothesis with respects to the association between
attentional biases and symptoms of depression was partially supported. Severity of depressive symptoms was positively associated
with the total ﬁxation time, but not ﬁrst ﬁxation duration, to sad
facial expressions. Although previous eye-tracking studies have
considered the ﬁrst ﬁxation time as an index of maintenance of
attention (Caseras et al., 2007), we considered the total ﬁxation
time to be a more robust index of sustained attention due to its
inclusion of processing across trials. In contrast, the ﬁrst ﬁxation
duration index only offers a snapshot of the beginning of each trial.
This difference between the two indices could explain the results
obtained in our study in relation to severity of depression. As expected, concordant with the study by Oehlberg et al. (2012), only
the bias to depression-related stimuli (i.e. sad faces) was associated
with depressive symptom scores. Again, this result suggests that
depression is a mood disorder speciﬁcally related to processing of
emotionally-congruent information rather than overall processing
of negative information (Gotlib, Kasch, et al., 2004).

Collectively, the results of the present study are consistent with
cognitive models (e.g. Beck, 1976) that have proposed that
depressed individuals show a greater tendency to process negative
information. Moreover, our study showed that depressed patients
prefer those interpersonal cues congruent with their mood. This
result may inform our understanding of why depressed persons
have interpersonal problems (Gotlib & Hammen, 2002). Yet, our
study suggests that, in regard to attention processes, attentional
biases appear not in initial stages of information processing but in
later ones. Although this adds a signiﬁcant step in the differentiation of attentional components in clinical depression, we
acknowledge some limitations in our study. Since our results are
based on cross-sectional data, we are unable to draw conclusions
about causality. A further limitation of this study is its relatively
small sample size and subsequently, its limited power in detecting
differences between the groups. Although this sample size is
common in similar studies using eye-tracking methodologies (e.g.,
Mogg et al., 2000), studies with larger samples of clinical participants and participants characterized by greater severity of symptoms could reveal stronger group differences in attentional biases
with regards to positive and negative information.
In summary, our study has conﬁrmed that clinically depressed
individuals do not show attentional biases to negative emotional
stimuli (i.e., sad and angry faces) in the initial stages of deployment
of attention (Mogg et al., 2000). Yet, total ﬁxation times revealed
that depressed participants showed a speciﬁc maintenance bias
towards sad faces. Moreover, the results showed a positive relationship between the magnitude of this attentional bias and the
severity of depressive symptoms. Finally, in regard to the processing of positive information, participants with MDD showed reduced
processing of happy faces in comparison to those who had never
been depressed. These results indicate that depression may be
associated with a double bias consisting of sustained attention to
negative stimuli and a simultaneous reduced attention to positive
stimuli. If these ﬁndings are replicated in further studies, future
interventions aimed at correcting cognitive biases could be developed to mitigate this bidirectional bias.
