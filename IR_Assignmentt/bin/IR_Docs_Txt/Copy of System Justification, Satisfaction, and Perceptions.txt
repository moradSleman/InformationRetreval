Abstract This research addresses system justification tendencies in the United
States and Hungary and their potential to shape reactions to equity–equality
tradeoffs in the workplace. Participants in both nations were asked to rate the
fairness of, their satisfaction with, and the typicality of four hypothetical work
situations. These scenarios differed in terms of which distributive justice principle
was violated (equity or equality) and whether the violation favored the participant or
the co-worker (self or other). While the mean level of system justification was lower
in Hungary than in the U.S., multilevel models revealed that in both societal contexts the motivation to justify the system was associated with participants’ perceptions of justice in the workplace. Based on the characteristics of the two social
systems, however, these tendencies played out differently. Specifically, for the U.S.
participants system justification was associated with more favorable views of work
situations that emphasized equity over equality and that rewarded the self over
others, whereas for Hungarian participants system justification was associated with
more favorable views of work situations that emphasized equality over equity and

that rewarded others over the self. Results also revealed that Americans (but not
Hungarians) who scored higher on system justification perceived as fairer that
which they perceived as more typical of their society. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the psychological transfer of legitimacy from socialism to
capitalism in Hungary remains incomplete.

According to system justification theory (Jost & Banaji, 1994), people seek to
maintain the legitimacy and stability of existing forms of social arrangements despite
putative inequities and inequalities. This tendency has been found to be subject to
several dispositional and situational variables, including epistemic and existential
motives to minimize uncertainty and threat (Jost & Hunyady, 2005). Although
system justification has been shown to operate in different national contexts (e.g.,
Jost, Kivetz, Rubini, Guermandi, & Mosso, 2005; Kay, Czaplinski, & Jost, 2009a;
Mandisodza, Jost, & Unzueta, 2006; Ullrich & Cohrs, 2007), direct cross-national
comparisons have yet to be undertaken to determine whether different types of social
systems, each characterized by a unique historical backdrop and development, are
justified to a different extent or in different ways. The present study represents a first
step in this direction and examines possible differences in system-justifying beliefs
between a long-established Western, Capitalist democracy, the United States, and an
Eastern European ‘‘new democracy’’ (i.e., a formerly Socialist state), Hungary.

System Justification in Context
There are many reasons that system-justifying beliefs might be conditioned by
societal phenomena, such as the political structure, the legal justice system, gender
relations, religion, social customs, the economic structure, and the distribution
system within a society. We know from research on system justification in the
United States that context legitimacy has an effect on its magnitude. People tend to
justify the status quo to a significantly larger extent when it is perceived as
legitimate (Haines & Jost, 2000; Jost, 2001; Tajfel, 1981; Tyler, 2006). Situational
factors, such as circumstances of high system threat and mortality salience, have
also been shown to enhance the appeal of system-justifying beliefs. Specifically,
threats to the legitimacy and stability of the system lead people to increase their use
of stereotypes to justify social and economic inequalities and to defend the societal
status quo more vigorously (Kay, Jost, & Young, 2005; see also Jost et al., 2005).
Ullrich and Cohrs (2007) conducted four experiments in which they manipulated the
salience of terrorism as a threat to the social order and found that this manipulation
increased participants’ scores on a system justification scale.
System justification theory suggests that people are motivated to defend, bolster,
and rationalize the social systems that affect them because doing so serves basic

123

epistemic, existential, and relational needs (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost,
Burgess, & Mosso, 2001; Jost & Hunyady, 2005; Jost, Ledgerwood, & Hardin,
2008; Kay et al., 2007). That is, believing the social system is the way it should be
helps to reduce uncertainty, manage threat, and may facilitate the sense that values
and attitudes are socially shared. Jost and Hunyady (2005) further suggested that
system justification serves the palliative function of reducing negative affect and
increasing positive affect. In several studies, we find that giving people the
opportunity to justify the system does indeed lead them to feel better and more
satisfied and to report feeling more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions
(e.g., Jost, Wakslak, & Tyler, 2008; Wakslak, Jost, Tyler, & Chen, 2007).
System justification theory does not imply that people always perceive the status
quo as completely fair and just, as the system justification motive may vary across
individuals, groups, and situations. Nor do system justification motives preclude the
occurrence of social change (e.g., Feygina, Jost, & Goldsmith, 2010). However,
system justification theory does imply that people will protest only when the
system’s legitimacy has been seriously eroded and when alternatives to the status
quo become psychologically salient (see also Tajfel, 1981). In addition, people
should be motivated to rationalize a new or emerging regime as its implementation
is seen as increasingly probable (e.g. Eidelman, Crandall, & Pattershall, 2009; Kay,
Jimenez, & Jost, 2002).
Distributive Justice Principles
Researchers of social justice typically distinguish among three potentially conflicting principles for allocating resources, namely equity (or merit or proportionality),
equality, and need (e.g., Adams, 1965; Deutsch, 1975, 1985; Jost & Kay, 2010;
Lerner, 1974). Studies have generally supported Deutsch’s (1975) contention that
these three distributive justice principles tend to vary in their applicability, and so
are differentially valued as a function of contextual factors as well as individual
difference variables (Barrett-Howard & Tyler, 1986; Bolino & Turnley, 2008; Clark
& Mills, 1979; Deaux & Major, 1987; Deutsch, 1985; Folger, Sheppard, & Buttram,
1995; Reis, 1984). In general, distributing resources on the basis of equity facilitates
individual productivity, whereas the equality principle fosters interpersonal
harmony; allocating resources according to the needs of group members tends to
maximize their subjective well-being (e.g., Deutsch, 1975; Leung & Park, 1986).
Along these lines, Deutsch (1985) has proposed a ‘‘crude law of social relations,’’
by which ‘‘the characteristic processes and effects elicited by a given type of social
relationship also tend to elicit that type of social relationship’’ (p. 69, emphasis
omitted). That is, competitively structured social systems (like capitalism) beget
competitive, individualistic preferences and characteristics, whereas cooperatively
structured systems (like socialism) beget more cooperative, egalitarian tendencies.
From the perspective of system justification theory, people should judge fairer
situations as more typical than unfair situations and, conversely, more typical
situations as fairer than atypical situations. In other words, ratings of fairness and
typicality should be positively correlated, especially for those who (for situational or
dispositional reasons) engage in system justification. This process may be thought of

123

192

Soc Just Res (2010) 23:189–210

as yet another instance of the naturalistic fallacy, i.e., conflating what ‘‘is’’ with
what ‘‘ought’’ to be (Berger, Zelditch, Anderson, & Cohen, 1972; Heider, 1958;
Homans, 1974) or ‘‘injunctification,’’ defined as the tendency to endow descriptive
norms (or states of affairs) with prescriptive force (Kay et al., 2009b; see also
Eidelman et al., 2009). Individuals who are especially low in system justification
motivation (or high on the tendency to challenge or criticize the societal status quo)
might be expected to show the opposite bias, namely judging unfair situations as
more typical (or more typical situations as less fair).
Some work in sociology suggests that there may be a stronger association in
Western Europe and North America than in Central/Eastern Europe between
distribution rules that are thought to be applied and distribution rules that people
think ought to be applied. According to Csepeli and Örkény (1992, pp. 15–16), the
relationship of mutual support between the economy and ideology ‘‘was never fully
attained in any Eastern European socialist society’’ (see also Homans, 1974). Alwin,
Gornev, and Khakhulina (1995) found that in transitional (i.e., post-Communist)
societies, there was a weaker relationship between the salaries survey respondents
earned and the salaries they felt they deserved compared to Western capitalist
societies (see also Marshall, Swift, Routh, & Burgoyne, 1999).
System-Justifying Beliefs in Hungary and the United States
Because Hungary remains, at least to some extent, in a state of transition from
socialism to capitalism (e.g., Kluegel, Mason, & Wegener, 1995; Mason & Kluegel,
2000), it provides an interesting context in which to investigate system-justifying
tendencies. Hungarians (like other Central/Eastern Europeans) might find themselves
‘‘oscillating’’ between desires to hold onto the way things were in socialist times,
while at the same time endorsing the legitimacy and fairness of the capitalist system
that increasingly takes hold (see also Jost, Blount, Pfeffer, & Hunyady, 2003). As a
result, Hungarians might be expected to hold complex, ambivalent attitudes
concerning the major distributive fairness principles of equality, which is associated
with cooperative interdependence and socialist economic models, and equity, which
is linked to economic competition under capitalism (see Deutsch, 1985).
The United States, by contrast, has long been a capitalist nation with a firmly
established market-based economy. American perceptions of what constitutes the
status quo should therefore be less ambiguous, and support for the socioeconomic
system in the U.S. context should be clearly associated with a preference for equity
(i.e., rewarding people on the basis of individual effort and/or ability) over equality
of outcomes (e.g., Clark & Mills, 1979; Deutsch, 1975; Jost & Kay, 2010; Lerner,
1974; Leung & Stephan, 2001; Mitchell, Tetlock, Newman, & Lerner, 2003;
Walster, Walster, & Berscheid, 1978). That is, the prevailing view in the U.S. is that
success is determined by individual ability and effort and therefore that economic
inequality is often legitimate (Hochschild, 1981; Jost, Blount, et al., 2003; Jost,
Pelham, Sheldon, & Sullivan, 2003; Kluegel & Smith, 1986; Major, 1994; Martin,
1986).
There is also some reason to expect that Hungarians would display lower levels
of system justification in general, in comparison with Americans. Hunyady (2005),

123

Soc Just Res (2010) 23:189–210

193

for instance, has argued that many Hungarians believe that their country’s social,
economic, and political institutions are flawed and frequently reward those who are
undeserving. Survey data collected by the Gallup Organization in Hungary revealed
that in 1998 three-quarters of the population believed that economic success in
Hungary depended strongly on personal connections, ‘‘pulling strings,’’ and even
unethical behavior. The ‘‘rules of the game’’ by which people are rewarded at work
are not yet firmly established (Manchin, 2000), and the concept of economic
‘‘success’’ has somewhat negative connotations in Hungary (Váriné Szilágyi &
Solymosi, 1999). Cross-cultural comparisons confirm that Hungarians score
significantly lower on the ‘‘belief in a just world’’ scale than do residents of
Western nations (Sallay & Krotos, 2004), but such findings are by no means
confined to the Hungarian context alone. According to Kreidl (2000), citizens of
post-Communist countries tend to perceive a great deal of economic inequality in
their societies and to regard it as unjust; this is consistent with the notion that
socialist ideals have yet to fade away entirely.
Wojciszke, Baryla, and Mikiewicz (2008) directly investigated system-justifying
tendencies in Poland. They used a Polish translation of Kay and Jost’s (2003, p. 828)
general system justification scale and found that a large majority of their sample
perceived the system as unjust and lacking legitimacy overall. However, despite
these low levels of system justification, system-justifying beliefs still served a
palliative function for the participants (cf. Jost & Hunyady, 2002). That is,
participants scoring high on system justification also exhibited higher levels of
satisfaction with their lives in general, their achievements, and the state of the
country. We therefore hypothesized that although Hungarians might be expected to
justify their own system to a lesser extent than Americans, the extent to which they
do engage in system justification would predict relatively favorable views of
specific system features, such as common business practices (cf. Jost, Blount, et al.,
2003). Thus, we conducted a cross-national comparison involving the U.S. and
Hungary, focusing on the relationship between attitudes toward the social system in
general (i.e., system justification) and perceptions of distributive justice principles
in the workplace.
Perceptions of Fairness in the Workplace
We investigated views held by U.S. and Hungarian participants concerning
distributive justice perceptions at work on the assumption that different types of
social systems (e.g., socialism and capitalism) would affect the perceived fairness of
equity–equality tradeoffs (see Deutsch, 1985). Participants were asked to envision
themselves in relation to a fictitious co-worker in four hypothetical work situations,
which differed in terms of which distributive justice principle (equity or equality)
was violated and whether the violation favored the co-worker or the participant
himself or herself. Participants were asked to rate the fairness and typicality of the
different scenarios and to indicate their degree of satisfaction (or dissatisfaction)
with them. We hypothesized that at least in the U.S. system justification would be
associated with stronger perceptions of fairness of and satisfaction with equitybased salary distributions. We also hypothesized that the more participants justified

123

194

Soc Just Res (2010) 23:189–210

the socioeconomic system, the more they would perceive as fair that which they
perceived as typical of their society.
We differentiated between salary distributions that favor the self and those that
favor the other to determine whether self-interested motivations would play out
differently within each society. Based on self-interest assumptions, we hypothesized
that participants would perceive scenarios that benefit the self as more fair and
satisfying than scenarios that benefit the other (e.g., Boll, Ferring, & Filipp, 2005;
Loewenstein, Thompson, & Bazerman, 1989). Such perceptions are, nonetheless,
culture-bound, at least to some degree. For example, egocentric biases in
negotiation contexts—i.e., viewing one’s own behavior and larger shares for
oneself as fairer—were found to be more common in the U.S. than Japan (Gelfand
et al., 2002). Thus, we expected that U.S. participants who scored high (vs. low) in
terms of system justification would rate salary distributions favoring the self as
fairer and more satisfying in comparison with Hungarian participants who scored
high on system justification.

Summary of Hypotheses
With regard to system-justifying beliefs, we predicted that the magnitude and
consequences of system justification would differ in the two societal contexts.
Specifically, based on prior research we anticipated that the U.S. participants would
score higher on general system justification than would Hungarian participants
(Hypothesis 1). We further hypothesized that participants, regardless of country,
would perceive the equitable (but unequal) salary distributions as more fair and
satisfying than equal (but inequitable) salary distributions (Hypothesis 2). At the same
time, we considered the alternative possibilities that Hungarian participants would
perceive the equal but inequitable salary distributions as (a) fairer and more satisfying
than the U.S. participants, to the extent that they might continue to harbor at least some
degree of psychological attachment to the former (socialist) regime (Hypothesis 3a),
or (b) less fair and less satisfying than the U.S. participants, insofar as they might be
eager to embrace the (relatively new) capitalist system and to distance themselves
from their socialist legacy (Hypothesis 3b). Based on prior research, we expected that
in both countries justice violations favoring the self would be rated as more fair and
satisfying than violations favoring the other (Hypothesis 4a), although we also
considered the possibility derived from cross-cultural research that egocentric biases
in fairness perceptions would be greater in the U.S. than Hungary (Hypothesis 4b).
We hypothesized that in both contexts efforts to justify the system would be
reflected in perceptions of the workplace, such that high system-justifiers would
perceive certain distribution types to be fairer and more satisfying in comparison
with low system-justifiers. Specifically, because of the longstanding nature of the
capitalist system in the U.S., system justification in the U.S. would be associated with
greater perceived fairness of and satisfaction with equity-based salary distributions
(Hypothesis 5). It was less clear whether system justification in Hungary would be
associated with preferences for equity or equality when they are in opposition. We
did hypothesize that Americans scoring high on system justification would rate salary

123

Soc Just Res (2010) 23:189–210

195

distributions favoring the self as more fair and satisfying than Hungarian participants
scoring high on system justification, insofar as capitalist ideology sanctions the
pursuit of self-interest (Hypothesis 6). Finally, we predicted that the more
participants justified the system, the more they would perceive as fair that which
they believe to be most typical of their society (Hypothesis 7).

Method
Participants
The U.S. sample consisted of 108 students (70% female; mean age = 19.35,
SD = 1.14) at New York University who participated to fulfill a course
requirement. The Hungarian sample consisted of 114 students (75% female; mean
age = 20.16, SD = 2.08) at Eötvös Loránd University who participated as part of a
class exercise.
Procedure
Participants were presented with a packet of questionnaires. They were asked to
envision themselves in relation to a fictitious co-worker in four hypothetical work
situations, which differed on two dimensions (‘‘scenario type’’ with two levels and
‘‘direction’’ with two levels). The different scenario types depicted different
principles of distributive justice, such that participants were asked to imagine
themselves in situations in which: (a) harder work resulted in higher pay (‘‘equitable
but unequal’’ scenario), and (b) harder work resulted in equal pay (‘‘equal but
inequitable’’ scenario). The direction of the distribution of resources was such that
the situation either favored the participant or the co-worker (i.e., the participant was
either advantaged or disadvantaged by the inequity/inequality). Participants were
asked to rate the fairness of each situation as well as their degree of satisfaction with
it and the extent to which it was typical or atypical. Finally, participants were asked
to complete a general system justification scale and to provide demographic
information. Afterward, they were probed for suspicion regarding the purpose of the
study, carefully debriefed, and dismissed.

Work Scenarios
Participants were presented with four work scenarios and were asked to respond to
three items tapping into fairness of, satisfaction with, and typicality of the scenario
after reading each scenario. The basic form of the scenario was as follows: ‘‘You are

For the Hungarian sample, the materials were presented in Hungarian, and the materials used in the
United States were presented in English. The salaries described in the Hungarian materials were lower in
absolute terms (in comparison with the U.S. materials) so as to be roughly comparable in terms of actual
living standards.

working for a company and have a net salary of $4200 a month. There is a coworker sitting next to you, doing the same job with the same experience, working
somewhat less hard/somewhat harder and performing somewhat worse than/
somewhat better than you. You have accidentally learned that this person has a net
salary of $3200/$4200/$5200 a month, less than/equal to/more than yours.’’ The
‘‘equitable but unequal scenario favoring the self’’ depicted a co-worker working
somewhat less hard and performing somewhat worse than the participant for a
salary of $3200 a month, which was less than the participant’s salary; the ‘‘equitable
but unequal scenario favoring the other’’ depicted a co-worker working somewhat
harder and performing somewhat better than the participant for a salary of $5200 a
month, which was more than the participant’s salary; the ‘‘equal but inequitable
scenario favoring the self’’ depicted a co-worker working somewhat harder and
performing somewhat better than the participant for a salary of $4200 a month,
which was equal to the participant’s salary; the ‘‘equal but inequitable scenario
favoring the other’’ depicted a co-worker working somewhat less hard and
performing somewhat worse than the participant for a salary of $4200 a month,
which was equal to the participant’s salary.
Perceived Fairness
After reading each scenario participants assessed the perceived fairness of the
situation by answering the following question: ‘‘How fair do you think these two
incomes are?’’ (1 = completely unfair, 9 = completely fair).
Satisfaction
The second item assessed participants’ degree of satisfaction with the situation. It
read: ‘‘In such a situation how satisfied would you be with your salary?’’ (1 = not
satisfied at all, 9 = entirely satisfied).
Perceived Typicality
The third item assessed the perceived typicality of the scenario and read: ‘‘How
typical do you think this kind of scenario is in the United States/Hungary? (1 = not
typical at all, 9 = very typical).
System Justification
Eight items assessed participants’ views about the system (Kay & Jost, 2003;
translated into Hungarian for the Hungarian sample). Responses were provided on
9-point scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). Sample
items include: ‘‘Everyone has a fair shot at wealth and happiness’’; ‘‘In general, the
American/Hungarian political system operates as it should’’; and ‘‘American/
Hungarian society needs to be radically restructured’’ (reverse-coded). Cronbach’s
alpha was .73 for Hungarian participants and .80 for the U.S. participants.

Results
We conducted a repeated measures analysis implemented in a multilevel modeling
framework to investigate the main and interactive effects of nation and system
justification on perceptions of each of the work scenarios. We used a multilevel
model because it allowed us to calculate interactions between categorical withinsubjects factors and continuous system justification scores. Specifically, we
computed a series of 2 (scenario type: equitable but unequal vs. equal but
inequitable) 9 2 (direction: favorable toward the self vs. favorable toward the
other) 9 2 (nation: USA vs. Hungary) 9 system justification models for each of the
dependent variables (with scenario type and direction treated as within-subjects
factors and nation and system justification treated as between-subjects factors). We
used a fixed-effects model with random intercepts. Participant ratings of fairness,
satisfaction, and typicality were predicted by nation (-1 = Hungary, 1 = USA),
system justification (centered on the overall mean), scenario type (-1 = equal but
inequitable, 1 = equitable but unequal), direction (-1 = benefiting other, 1 = benefiting self), and their interactions, adjusting for sex (-1 = female, 1 = male) and
age (on the overall mean). Table 1 lists means and standard deviations for variables
included in the model.
National Differences in System Justification
We conducted an Analysis of Covariance to investigate national differences in terms
of system justification scores with sex and age entered as covariates. The analysis
yielded a significant main effect for nation, F (1,218) = 14.89, p \ .001, such that
U.S. participants scored higher on the system justification scale (M = 4.44,
SE = .12) than did Hungarian participants (M = 3.81, SE = .11). This finding is
consistent with previous reports that Central/Eastern European respondents are less
supportive of the societal status quo than are Western respondents (e.g., Hunyady,
2005; Sallay & Krotos, 2004; Wojciszke et al., 2008).
Effects on Fairness Perceptions
The scenario type 9 direction 9 nation 9 system justification four-way multilevel
model yielded three main effects (see Table 2). First, as predicted, participants in
general perceived the equitable but unequal scenarios as fairer than the equal but
inequitable scenarios, b = 1.46, SE = .06, t (653.58) = 25.31, p \ .001. Second,
they perceived the scenarios benefiting the self as fairer than the scenarios benefiting
the other person, b = .12, SE = .06, t (653.58) = 2.05, p \ .05. Third, participants
scoring high on system justification perceived the work scenarios as fairer overall
than did participants scoring low on system justification, b = .17, SE = .06,
t (215.98) = 2.88, p \ .01.
The analysis yielded a significant two-way interaction between nation and
scenario type, b = -.32, SE = .06, t (653.58) = -5.63, p \ .001. Although both
U.S. and Hungarian participants perceived the equitable but unequal scenarios
as fairer than the equal but inequitable scenarios (b = 1.13, SE = .08,

Effects on Satisfaction
The scenario type 9 direction 9 nation 9 system justification four-way multilevel
model for the dependent measure of satisfaction yielded the same three main effects
obtained for perceived fairness (see Table 3). Participants were more satisfied with
the equitable but unequal than with the equal but inequitable situations, b = .66,
SE = .06, t (653.47) = 10.94, p \ .001. They were also more satisfied with the
situations benefiting the self than with those benefiting the other, b = .86, SE = .06,
t (653.47) = 14.28, p \ .001. System justification was positively associated with
satisfaction with respect to all of the scenarios, b = .16, SE = .07, t (215.95) =
2.36, p \ .05.
The analysis revealed a significant interaction between nation and scenario type,

in terms of satisfaction with the equitable but unequal scenarios, b = .06, SE = .13,

We obtained a significant two-way interaction between system justification and
direction, b = -.10, SE = .05, t (653.24) = -2.04, p \ .05. Participants who were
high on system justification were more satisfied with the scenarios benefiting the
other than were participants low on system justification, b = .26, SE = .08,
t (460.55) = 3.10, p \ .01; no such differences were observed for the scenarios
benefiting the self, b = .06, SE = .08, t (460.59) = .71, ns. The analysis also
yielded a significant two-way interaction between scenario type and direction,
b = -.34, SE = .06, t (653.47) = -5.65, p \ .001. The difference in satisfaction
between the two scenario types was greater for the scenarios benefitting the other,
b = 1.00, SE = .09, t (653.23) = 11.74, p \ .001, than for scenarios benefitting the
self, b = .32, SE = .09, t (653.72) = 3.74, p \ .001 (see Fig. 3).
As before, the three-way interaction involving nation, system justification, and
scenario type attained significance, b = .13, SE = .05, t (653.24) = 2.71, p \ .01.
Internal analyses revealed that Americans who scored high on system justification
were more satisfied with the equitable but unequal scenarios than were Americans
who were low on system justification, b = .27, SE = .12, t (463.83) = 2.29,

Effects on Perceived Typicality
The analysis for ratings of perceived typicality yielded only one significant main
effect (see Table 4). Participants in both the nations perceived the equal but
inequitable scenarios as more typical of their society than the equitable but unequal
scenarios, b = -.55, SE = .05, t (653.44) = -11.28, p \ .001. However, a twoway interaction involving system justification and scenario type, b = .17, SE = .04,
t (653.23) = 4.21, p \ .001, indicated that participants who scored high on system
justification perceived the equitable but unequal scenarios as more typical than did
participants who were low on system justification, b = .25, SE = .07,
t (415.95) = 3.40, p \ .01. No effect of system justification was observed for
ratings of the typicality of the equal but inequitable scenarios, b = -.09, SE = .07,
t (415.90) = -1.21, ns.
The analysis yielded a significant two-way interaction between nation and
direction, b = -.11, SE = .05, t (653.44) = -2.30, p \ .05. Hungarians perceived
the situations benefiting the self as marginally more typical than the situations
benefiting the other, b = .12, SE = .07, t (653.66) = 1.71, p \ .10, whereas
Americans perceived no such differences in typicality, b = -.11, SE = .07,
t (653.23) = -1.54, ns. A significant interaction between scenario type and
direction was also observed, b = -.13, SE = .05, t (653.44) = -2.58, p \ .05.
Participants perceived the equal but inequitable scenario as marginally more typical
when it benefitted the self than when it benefitted the other, b = .13, SE = .07,
t (653.64) = 1.89, p \ .10, but they perceived the equitable but unequal scenario as
marginally more typical when it benefitted the other versus the self, b = -.12,
SE = .07, t (653.23) = -1.76, p \ .10.
Once again, the analysis yielded a significant three-way interaction between
nation, system justification, and scenario type, b = -.11, SE = .04, t (653.23) =
-2.67, p \ .01. Internal analyses revealed that Hungarians who scored high on
system justification perceived the equitable but unequal scenarios as more typical
than did Hungarians who were low on system justification, b = .44, SE = .11,
t (410.95) = 4.14, p \ .001. System justification did not affect the perceived

typicality of the equal but inequitable scenarios among Hungarians, b = -.11,
SE = .11, t (411.03) = -1.09, ns. For Americans, however, system justification
was not differentially related to perceptions of typicality for the two scenario types,
ts \ 1, ns.
Does System Justification Moderate the Association Between Perceived
Typicality and Fairness?
We hypothesized that perceptions of typicality and fairness would be positively
associated and that system justification would magnify the strength of their
association, especially in the United States. The multilevel models described above
reveal that for Americans system justification was positively associated with
perceived fairness of the equitable but unequal scenarios, and that both high and low
system-justifiers perceived these situations as more typical than the equal but
inequitable scenarios. For Hungarians, on the other hand, system justification scores
were positively associated with perceived fairness of the equal but inequitable
scenarios and also with ratings of typicality for the equitable but equal scenarios. To
more fully explore our hypotheses, we conducted follow-up analyses for each nation
separately.
Specifically, we used fixed-effects models with random intercepts and direction
as a within-participants variable. First, we tested a model including system
justification, perceived typicality, direction, their interaction terms, and the
demographic variables as independent variables and the perceived fairness of the
equitable but unequal scenario as the dependent variable. Then, we tested the same
model to examine the perceived fairness of the equal but inequitable scenario (see

Table 5). For these analyses, all variables were centered on the respective country
means (see Table 1 for a summary of descriptive statistics).
For the American sample, we obtained a significant interaction effect of system
justification and perceived typicality on perceived fairness of the equitable but
unequal scenario, b = .15, SE = .06, t (201.55) = 2.67, p \ .01. Those scoring
higher on system justification perceived the equitable but unequal situations as more
fair to the extent that they also perceived them to be more typical of the nation (see
Fig. 4). This effect was not observed with regard to the equal but inequitable
situations, b = .04, SE = .07, t (204.93) = .56, ns. For Hungarians, system
justification did not interact with perceived typicality to predict perceptions of
fairness of the equitable but unequal situations, b = .05, SE = .06, t (216.69) = .99,
ns, or the equal but inequitable situations, b = .00, SE = .05, t (213.97) = .03, ns.

Discussion
Social justice researchers generally agree that the concern for justice is universal
(Lerner, 2003; Tyler & Smith, 1998; see also Brosnan, 2006), but its meaning and
significance vary according to sociocultural contexts (e.g., Leung, 2004; Van den Bos

& Lind, 2002). Leung (2004) has proposed that cultural dimensions such as
individualism–collectivism and power distance can help to explain cultural similarities and dissimilarities in preferences for distributive rules such as equity, equality,
and need (see also Brockner et al., 2001). However, relatively little is known about the
effects of other social psychological variables that could explain cross-cultural
differences in fairness perceptions. In this study, we have addressed the relationship
between system justification and perceptions of distributive justice in the workplace,
focusing on similarities and differences between the U.S. and Hungary.
Results confirmed expectations derived from previous work that U.S. participants
would endorse system-justifying attitudes more enthusiastically than Hungarian
participants (Hypothesis 1). There are at least two plausible explanations for the
difference. One possibility, which was proposed by Wojciszke et al. (2008),
concerns lingering effects of the previous regime. The egalitarian rhetoric
associated with Communism aroused distrust of disparities in income such that
‘‘any discussion of individual poverty was avoided, [but] wealth was positively
condemned’’ (Stephenson, 2000, p. 88). Public opinion data show that many citizens
of post-socialist nations are concerned about heightened economic inequality under
the market system (Gruen & Klasen, 2001; Ivanova, 2007), and this could contribute
to their lack of enthusiasm for the current system.
Another possibility is that the status quo in Hungary remains ambiguous, insofar
as Hungarians (and other Central/Eastern Europeans) find themselves experiencing
nostalgia for the economic security associated with the socialist period, while at the
same time subscribing to the legitimacy and fairness of the capitalist system that
increasingly takes hold. It would be useful in future research to determine whether
the same individuals ‘‘oscillate’’ between support for the current and former systems
or if some remain psychologically attached to the old system while others instead
justify the current system. Future research would also do well to address the causes
of diminished system justification in post-socialist countries as well as its potential

123

costs. For instance, a lack of institutional trust and morale may inhibit economic
productivity and long-term investment.
Our results reveal that participants, regardless of nation, perceived the equitable
but unequal salary distributions in the workplace as more fair and satisfying than the
equal but inequitable salary distributions (consistent with Hypothesis 2). Interestingly, Hungarian participants perceived the equal but inequitable salary distributions as even less fair and satisfying than did American participants (consistent with
Hypothesis 3b). This phenomenon may reflect a desire among Hungarians to justify
the newly emerging status quo (and to distance themselves from the former system).
At the same time, Hungarians’ attitudes toward the past are probably better
characterized as ambivalent rather than unequivocally negative. Participants in both
nations rated justice violations favoring the self as fairer and more satisfying than
the salary distributions favoring the other (consistent with Hypothesis 4a). Thus, we
observed no major cultural differences in egocentric bias (cf. Gelfand et al., 2002).
Despite mean-level differences in system justification scores, we expected that
the motivation to justify the status quo would predict distributive fairness judgments
in both societal contexts. In the U.S. and Hungary, efforts to justify the system were
reflected in perceptions of the workplace; based on the characteristics of the two
social systems, however, these tendencies played out differently. For American
participants, system justification was positively associated with perceived fairness
of and satisfaction with the equitable but unequal scenarios (consistent with
Hypothesis 5). For Hungarian participants, we obtained a different effect; system
justification was positively associated with perceived fairness of and satisfaction
with the equal but inequitable scenarios. This is why we would characterize
Hungarian attitudes in this study as ambivalent rather than entirely dismissive of
socialist ideals. Although Hungarians generally viewed the equity-based distribution
scheme more favorably than the equality-based scheme, system justification was
associated with positive reactions to equality. For Americans, it is clear that system
justification entails emphasizing (and valuing) the capitalist status quo of rewarding
equity (or merit). It is also associated with the perception that salary distributions
favoring the self are fairer and more satisfying than distributions favoring the other
(consistent with Hypothesis 6). For Hungarians, on the other hand, system
justification remains associated with the preservation of the ‘‘old’’ (egalitarian)
ways, at least to some extent.
We also hypothesized that the more U.S. participants justified the system, the
more they would regard ‘‘typical’’ salary arrangements as fair (Hypothesis 7).
Indeed, Americans who scored higher on system justification perceived the
equitable but unequal scenarios as more fair to the extent that they also perceived
them as more typical. This may well reflect a motivational process of injunctification, whereby participants whose system justification tendencies are chronically
or temporarily activated come to see what ‘‘is’’ as what ‘‘ought’’ to be (Eidelman
et al., 2009; Kay et al., 2009b). For Hungarian participants, however, system
justification did not affect the relationship between perceptions of typicality and
judgments of fairness. This was unpredicted but may be due to the fact that the
economic systems in Central and Eastern Europe possess less legitimacy than in the
West (e.g., Alwin et al., 1995).

Soc Just Res (2010) 23:189–210

207

When the Communist systems of Central and Eastern Europe crumbled in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, many observers assumed that the transition to marketbased economic models would be relatively smooth. This has not generally been the
case (e.g., Headey, Andorka, & Krause, 1995; Kluegel et al., 1995). There are
probably many reasons, including macroeconomic reasons, why the transition has
been more difficult than expected. However, social psychological factors have
received short shrift in discussions of what went wrong. Our work suggests, at least
obliquely, that perceptions of legitimacy and fairness are of genuine relevance, and
so is the degree of psychological allegiance to new versus old systems (i.e., the
effective transfer of system justification motivation). The findings from this and
other studies suggest that such a transfer remains incomplete.
