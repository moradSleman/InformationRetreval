Analytic and Algorithmic
Solution of Random
Satisﬁability Problems
M. Mézard,1 G. Parisi,1,2 R. Zecchina1,3*
We study the satisﬁability of random Boolean expressions built from many
clauses with K variables per clause (K-satisﬁability). Expressions with a ratio ␣
of clauses to variables less than a threshold ␣c are almost always satisﬁable,
whereas those with a ratio above this threshold are almost always unsatisﬁable.
We show the existence of an intermediate phase below ␣c, where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in search
algorithms. We introduce a class of optimization algorithms that can deal with
these metastable states; one such algorithm has been tested successfully on the
largest existing benchmark of K-satisﬁability.

lenge toward a greater understanding of the
onset of computational complexity and the
analysis of algorithms. Moreover, such hard
instances are a popular test bed for the performance of search algorithms (9).
The random Ksat problem has close similarities with models of complex materials
such as spin glasses, which are fundamental
systems in the statistical physics of disordered systems (10). Spin glasses deal with
binary variables (“spins”) interacting with
random exchange couplings. Each pair of
interacting spins can be seen as a constraint,
and finding the state of minimal energy in a
spin glass amounts to minimizing the number
of violated constraints. Although the constraints in spin glasses and Ksat differ with
respect to their precise form, in both cases the
difficulty comes from the possible existence
of “frustration” (11), which makes it difficult
to find the global optimal state by a purely
local optimization procedure. Links between
combinatorial optimization and statistical
physics have been known for years (10, 12,
13). Techniques from statistical physics are
particularly useful when the size of the instance is large.
Two main categories of questions can be
addressed. One type is algorithmic (e.g., finding an algorithm that decides whether an
instance is SAT or UNSAT, or that tries to
minimize the number of violated constraints).
Another one is more theoretical and deals
with random instances for which one wants to
predict the typical behavior (e.g., phase transitions and structure of the solution space).
We address the two types of questions in
the 3sat problem. When the numbers of variables N and of clauses M both increase at a
fixed value of ␣ ⫽ M/N, random Ksat problems become generically SAT at small ␣ and
generically UNSAT at large ␣. The existence
of a SAT-UNSAT phase transition in the
infinite N limit has been established rigorously for any K (14), but the critical value ␣c

The K-satisfiability problem (Ksat) asks
whether one can satisfy simultaneously a set
of M constraints between N Boolean variables, where each constraint is a clause built
as the logical OR involving K variables (or
their negations). Ksat is at the core of combinatorial optimization theory (1) and often
serves as a benchmark for search algorithms
in artificial intelligence and computer science. An efficient algorithm for solving Ksat
for K ⱖ 3 would immediately lead to other
algorithms for efficiently solving thousands
of different hard combinatorial problems.
The class of combinatorial problems sharing
such a crucial feature is called NP-complete
(2), and it is a basic conjecture of modern
computer science that no such efficient algorithm exists. Algorithms that are used to
solve real-world NP-complete problems display a huge variability of running times,
ranging from linear to exponential. A theory
for the typical-case behavior of algorithms,
on classes of random instances chosen from a
given probability distribution, is therefore the
natural complement to the worst-case analysis (3–5). Whereas 1sat and 2sat problems are
solved efficiently by polynomial time algorithms (6), K ⬎ 2 randomly generated Boolean formulae may become extraordinarily
difficult to solve: It has been observed numerically (7, 8) that computationally hard
random instances are generated when the
problems are critically constrained [i.e., close
to the satisfiable-unsatisfiable (SATUNSAT ) phase boundary]. The study of critical instances represents a theoretical chal-

(that separates the two phases) has been
found only in the ( polynomial) K ⫽ 2 problem where ␣c ⫽ 1 (15–17). For the NPcomplete case K ⱖ 3, much less is known.
The present best numerical estimate for ␣c at
K ⫽ 3 is 4.26 (18), and the rigorous bounds
are 3.42 ⬍ ␣c ⬍ 4.506 (19, 20); previous
statistical mechanics analysis, using the replica method, has found ␣c(3) ⬃ 4.48 (21) and
␣c(3) ⬃ 4.396 (22) in the framework of variational approximations. The SAT-UNSAT
decision problem is also known experimentally to be algorithmically harder to solve in
the neighborhood of ␣c, depending on the
characteristics of the SAT-UNSAT phase
transition. Indeed, 2sat and 3sat are different
in this respect (23).
Setting out the statistical physics
problem. The Ksat problem deals with N
Boolean variables xi, i 僆 {1, . . . , N}. Each
clause a 僆 {1, . . . , M} involves K variables
{xi1(a), . . . , xiK(a)}. Each such variable can be
negated or not, and the clause is built as the
OR function of the K resulting variables. In
physical terms, the variable xi can be represented by a “spin” si ⫽ ⫾1 through the
one-to-one mapping si ⫽ ⫺1 if xi is false and
si ⫽ ⫹1 if xi is true. For each variable xir(a)
appearing in clause a, one introduces a “coupling” Jar ⫽ ⫺1 if the variable appears negated in the clause; otherwise the coupling is Jar
⫽ 1. The sets of indices i1(a), . . . , iK(a) and of
“couplings” Ja ⫽ {J1a , . . . , JK
a } define an instance of the problem under study. Given a
spin configuration, the “energy” εJa(si 1(a), . . . ,
sik(a)) of clause a is equal to 0 if the clause is
satisfied, or equal to 1 if it is violated (24).
The total energy E equals the number of
violated clauses.
In statistical physics, one assigns to each
of the 2N spin configurations a Boltzmann
probability exp(⫺␤E)/Z, where ␤ is an auxiliary parameter playing the role of the inverse of temperature, and Z is a normalization
term; here we are interested in the ␤ 3 ⬁
“zero-temperature” limit, where Boltzmann’s
law selects optimal states.
The spin glass approach. We first study
the large N limit of the random 3sat problem,
where the indices in each clause are chosen
randomly, as well as the sign of each coupling, with uniform distributions. Our approach to these problems uses a general strategy initiated years ago in spin glass theory
(10). The first concept we need to introduce is
that of a state. Roughly speaking, states correspond to connected regions of configurations, such that one must cross energy barriers that diverge when N 3 ⬁ to go from one
state to another. The archetype of such a
situation is the ferromagnetic transition
where the spins collectively polarize, either
toward an “up” state or toward a “down”
state. In frustrated systems such as satisfiability problems, many states can exist: The

RESEARCH ARTICLES
number of states with energy E behaves as
exp[N ⌺(e)], where e ⬅ E/N; the function
⌺(e), called the complexity, is a crucial concept in studies of structural glasses. The
ground-state energy density e can be found
by the condition ⌺(e) ⫽ 0. Here we choose a
restricted zero-temperature definition that applies to random Ksat: A state is simply a
cluster of configurations of equal energy related by single spin-flip moves, such that the
energy cannot be decreased by any sequence
of single spin flips (25). Generalizing the
approach of (26), one can develop a whole
“zero-temperature thermodynamics” of the
states by introducing a “free energy” function

deduced from Eq. 1. The order parameter of

that u ⫽ 0. Using this simplification, we have
been able to compute (31) the statistical distribution of surveys in random graphs in the

The reweighting y is a Lagrange parameter
(similar to an inverse temperature) that allows the energy of the states to be fixed.
Larger reweighting selects states of lower
energies until one reaches y ⫽ y*, corresponding to the lowest energy states (y* ⫽ ⬁
in the SAT region).
The cavity method: Message-passing
procedures. To compute ⌽(y), we use the
zero-temperature cavity method (27, 28), in
which the basic ingredients are the cavity
fields and the cavity biases, which are defined
in each state. The cavity field hi3a measures
the tendency of spin i to be up, when one of
the clauses, a, to which i belongs, has been
disconnected (Fig. 1). It is equal to the sum of
cavity biases ub3i, sent to site i from all the
other clauses b to which it belongs. In computer science terminology, cavity fields are
messages sent from a variable node to a
function node, whereas cavity biases are messages sent from a function node to a variable
node (29). The cavity biases are determined
by a local optimization procedure. Consider
one clause a, involving K variables s1, . . . , sK,
and a penalty function εJ(s1, . . . , sK). The
optimization on the variables s2, . . . , sK, expressed as

graphs have loops with a typical length growing as log(N). As the cavity fields h2, . . . , hK
are defined in the absence of the clause,
they correspond to faraway variables [with
a distance of order log(N)]. The “clustering
property,” valid inside each state, implies
that their correlations go to zero at large N
(on a real tree they would be fully uncorrelated). The topology of the graph implies
that the cavity equations are exact on finite
subgraphs.
To determine the statistical properties of
the set of cavity biases and how they change
from state to state, we introduce “surveys,”
which are histograms of cavity biases. For
each state ␻, there is one cavity bias u␻a31
propagated from one clause a to site 1; it can
be computed from Eq. 2, where the cavity
fields are those corresponding to the state ␻.
For a given value of the reweighting, the
survey propagated to spin s1 in Fig. 1 is
␻
defined as Q(y)
a31(u) ⫽ C⌺␻␦(u ⫺ u a31),
where C is a normalization constant ensuring
that Q(y)
a31(u) is a probability distribution,
and the sum over ␻ is restricted to the states
having the energy density e selected by the
reweighting y.

The advantage of cavity biases and cavity
fields in large (N ⬎⬎ 1) random Ksat and spin
glass problems is the special structure of the
interaction graph: It is locally tree-like, and
the connectivity fluctuates from site to site
with a Poisson distribution of mean K␣ (see

instances in the hard regime. Satisfying
assignments have been found for all benchmarks. We have applied the SID to much
larger instances, increasing N up to N ⫽
105 at a fixed ␣ ⫽ 4.2. The algorithm is
very efficient: It always finds a SAT configuration, and its apparent complexity
scales like N2, although more systematic
studies with higher statistics will be necessary to establish this behavior. For the very
same large instances, the only existing algorithm able to find solutions, at a considerable computational cost, is a highly optimized version of the walksat algorithm (9,
35).
Conclusions. We have proposed an analytical method that predicts quantitatively the
phase diagram of the random 3sat problem in
the limit of infinite number of clauses and
opens the way to other types of algorithms. The
existence of an intermediate phase with many
metastable states close to the SAT-UNSAT
transition explains the slowing down of algorithms in this region. We would like to stress
that the solution we propose is typical of a
“one-step replica symmetry-breaking” solution,
as it is called in spin glasses (10). All the
consistency checks of the analytic results lead
us to believe that this solution is exact for the
3sat problem. From the strict mathematical
point of view, the phase diagram we propose
should be considered as a conjecture, as for the
great majority of the theoretical results in statistical physics. Our computation implies that a
way to provide a fully rigorous proof of the
transition behavior in random Ksat problems
could be based on the study of the decomposition of the probability measure into states endowed with the clustering property (36). On the
other hand, the predictions of our theory can be
compared with numerical experiments, and our
first such tests have confirmed its validity. On
the basis of the analytical study, our algorithm
looks promising in that it can solve large instances exploring a rather small number of spin
configurations. It will be interesting to explore
its application to other optimization problems.

convergence provides a nontrivial information on the structure of the states. From all the
surveys sent onto one site i, we reconstruct
through a reweighted convolution (34) the
probability distribution of local fields on this
site, Pi(H). This is a distribution on integers
[Pi(H) ⫽ ⌺r␦(H ⫺ r)w ri ]. The total weight

⌺r⫽⫺⬁
the fraction of zero-energy states where si ⫽

instances with N ⫽ 10,000, that these fractions predicted from survey propagation
agree with those obtained by averaging on a
few hundreds of ground states.
A decimation algorithm. This information can be exploited to invent new types of
algorithms (31) or to improve existing ones.
We have worked out one such application,
the survey inspired decimation (SID), which
shows promising performance, but other algorithms probably could be found using the
same type of information. Given an instance,
we first compute all the surveys by the survey
propagation algorithm with a sufficiently
large value of y (e.g., y ⫽ 6). Then we deduce
the distribution of local fields, and in particular their weights wi⫾ on positive and negative integers. We then fix the variable i with
largest wi⫹ ⫺ wi⫺ to the value si ⫽
Sign(wi⫹ ⫺ wi⫺). Satisfied clauses are eliminated, and unsatisfied K-clauses involving i
are transformed into K ⫺ 1 clauses, leading to
a new instance with a reduced number of
variables (and of clauses). The surveys can be
propagated again on this new instance (starting from the previous ones) until convergence, and the procedure is iterated. Whenever a paramagnetic state is found (signaled
by all ␩a3i ⫽ 1) or at some intermediate
steps, a rapid search process like simulated
annealing at a fixed cooling rate is run.
This SID algorithm has been tested successfully on the largest (up to N ⫽ 2000)
existing benchmarks (9) of random 3sat

White Collar–1, a Circadian Blue
Light Photoreceptor, Binding to
the frequency Promoter
Allan C. Froehlich,1 Yi Liu,1* Jennifer J. Loros,1,2†
Jay C. Dunlap1†
In the fungus Neurospora crassa, the blue light photoreceptor(s) and signaling
pathway(s) have not been identiﬁed. We examined light signaling by exploiting
the light sensitivity of the Neurospora biological clock, speciﬁcally the rapid
induction by light of the clock component frequency (frq). Light induction of frq
is transcriptionally controlled and requires two cis-acting elements (LREs) in the
frq promoter. Both LREs are bound by a White Collar–1 ( WC-1)/White Collar–2
( WC-2)–containing complex ( WCC), and light causes decreased mobility of the
WCC bound to the LREs. The use of in vitro–translated WC-1 and WC-2
conﬁrmed that WC-1, with ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor, is the blue
light photoreceptor that mediates light input to the circadian system through
direct binding (with WC-2) to the frq promoter.
In Neurospora, a wide range of processes is
light sensitive, including suppression and
phase shifting of circadian rhythms, phototropism of perithecial beaks (1), and carotenoid biosynthesis (initially described in the
first published study of Neurospora in 1843)
(2). The photoreceptor(s) involved in these
blue light–influenced processes has not been
identified, but screens in Neurospora for mutants involved in light perception and signaling have repeatedly turned up two indispensable loci, wc-1 and wc-2 (3). WC-1 and
WC-2 are nuclear transcription factors conDepartments of 1Genetics and 2Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.

taining trans-activation and zinc-finger (Znfinger) DNA binding domains (4, 5). They
form a White Collar Complex (WCC) by
heterodimerizing via PAS (PER ARNT SIM)
domains (6, 7) and act as positive elements in
light signaling, most likely through direct
binding of DNA (4, 5); in true wc-1KO and
wc-2KO strains, all examined light responses
are lost (8, 9). This requirement suggested to
us and others that either WC-1 or WC-2 is the
photoreceptor, or that they both are required
to mediate the response of an unidentified,
perhaps duplicated, receptor (1, 10, 11).
In Neurospora, generation of circadian
rhythms is dependent on WCC-mediated rhythmic production of frq transcript and protein,
both of which are central clock components
(12, 13). Light causes a rapid induction of frq
message, the central means by which light influences the clock (14). In the absence of WC-1
or WC-2, light induction of frq is completely

abolished, highlighting the WCs’ central role in
light input to the clock (8, 9, 15).
Effects of light in vivo. To examine the
contribution of transcription to the light-induced accumulation of frq transcript, the frq
promoter was fused to a reporter gene, hph,
and the resulting construct, pYL40B, was
transformed into a frq⫹ strain. Light treatment of transformants resulted in a marked
increase in hph transcript level, similar to that
of frq (Fig. 1A). Because only frq promoter
sequence was fused to hph, light induction of
the hph transcript, and consequently of endogenous frq message, is controlled at the
transcriptional level.
We identified cis-acting elements mediating light induction of frq by transforming frq
promoter deletion constructs into a frqKO
strain and the testing for light induction of frq
message (Fig. 1B). Deletion of two light response elements (LREs) in the frq promoter
decreased light induction of frq message. We
noted an ⬃50% reduction with the distal LRE
deleted (AF26) and an ⬃70% reduction with
the proximal LRE deleted (AF33) (Fig. 1C).
Deletion of both LREs (AF36) abolished
light induction of frq transcript (Fig. 1C),
which suggests that light induction of frq is
controlled entirely at the transcriptional level.
Both LREs were also sufficient to confer
light inducibility on an hph reporter construct
( pAF35), both individually ( pAF43 and
pAF44) and together ( pAF45) (Fig. 1D).
The effects of the LRE deletions on circadian clock function were examined using
race tubes to monitor Neurospora’s rhythmic
conidiation (11). In a wild-type strain, transferring race tubes from light to dark results in
a decrease in frq transcript that sets the clock
to subjective dusk, after which the clock continues to run (11, 14). Control ABC1 transformants, containing the entire frq locus, displayed a period and phase similar to those of
