The Ethics Of
Accountability In
Managed Care Reform
Recent efforts at reforming managed care practices have one
thing in common: a call for accountability to consumers.

No country in the world can afford all of the
medical care that providers can render to populations. Thus, in
every nation governments and private-sector organizations
design mechanisms that ration resources in ways that seem
compatible with the values of a particular society. For the most
part, governments establish these mechanisms, and most of the
resources flow through public budgets or at least publicly
fashioned funding channels. But in the United States the
purchasers of medical care have increasingly favored the
allocation of resources through marketlike mechanisms rather
than by government regulation. Consumers and providers have
found many of these strictures objectionable and have argued
that private health plans must be called to greater
accountability for their allocation decisions.
In this paper Norman Daniels, a philosopher, and James
Sabin, a physician, argue that the basis for assuring
accountability in a democratic society is through the use of
processes that accentuate fairness and openness. In the current
political climate, neither party seems prepared to leave the
development of these processes to the private marketplace, but
whether Congress can achieve consensus on these contentious
issues before the end of the 105th session is debatable.
Daniels is Goldthwaite Professor and former chair of the
Philosophy Department at Tufts University. He has written
widely on ethics and public policy, and he recently coauthored
a book on the ethical implications of the human genome
project. Sabin is an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at
the Harvard Medical School and codirects the Center for
Ethics in Managed Care sponsored by Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care Center and the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard.

Two notions of accountability embodied in proposals to reform
managed care have different ethical implications. Market accountability requires plans to inform purchasers and consumers about performance and
options, in theory legitimizing limits to care through consumer choice. Recognizing the limits of consumer choice, accountability for reasonableness requires
that the rationales for limits to services be public and be based on reasons or
rules that “fair-minded” people can agree are relevant to pursuing appropriate
patient care under necessary resource constraints. Accountability for reasonableness educates clinicians and patients about the need for limits and empowers a more focused public deliberation in which ultimate authority for limiting
care rests with democratic processes.

P

ub l ic a ccou nt a b il it y is the apple pie and motherhood of
health care reform. All reform efforts—President Clinton’s
Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, the Principles
for Consumer Protection proposed by a coalition of health plans and
consumers, the many legislative proposals introduced at the federal
and state levels, and the accreditation and performance standards by
the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)—call for
robust disclosure of relevant information about health plan benefits
and performance, and “due process” in the form of a grievance or
appeals procedure.1
Accountability has obvious appeal. Disclosure informs our consent, not just to treatments but to our choice of providers and plans.
Informed choice expresses our autonomy and is the lever that
pushes markets to work responsively and efficiently.
There are, however, two distinct notions of public accountability:
market accountability and accountability for reasonableness. It is
important to distinguish between them because they are central to
quite different views about what constitutes a fair and just health
care system. In our mixed public/private system, both are necessary.
Market accountability is the idea that information about performance and options must be made available to purchasers and enrollees in managed care plans so that they can effectively make
choices among plans, clinicians, and treatments. Only with such
information can consumers and purchasers leverage providers to
improve quality of care and be responsive to patients’ needs and
desires. Accountability for reasonableness is the idea that the rationales
for important managed care plan decisions should not only be publicly available, but should also be those that “fair-minded” people
can agree are relevant to pursuing appropriate patient care under
necessary resource constraints.
By fair-minded we do not simply mean like-minded friends who
just happen to agree with us. We mean people who in principle seek
to cooperate with others on terms that are mutually justifiable.

Indeed, fair-minded people accept rules of the game—or sometimes
seek rule changes—that promote the game’s essential skills and the
excitement that their use produces. Such rules aim at “the common
good.” Of course, having rules of a game that fair-minded people
accept does not eliminate all controversy about the application of
those rules. Nor does it eliminate all rule violations. It does, however, narrow the scope of controversy and the methods for adjudicating them.
In the “game” of delivering health care, whether through public or
private insurance schemes, fair-minded people will seek reasons
they can accept as relevant to meeting consumers’ needs fairly under
resource constraints. As in football or fishing, the rules shape a
conception of the common good that is the goal of cooperation
within plans, even when plans compete. In health care delivery, as in
football, some will seek “mere advantage” by ignoring the rules or by
imposing rules that benefit only them, and there will still be disagreement about how to apply the rules. Still, the fair-minded search
for mutually acceptable rules narrows the scope of disagreement
and the grounds on which disputes can be adjudicated.
Accountability for reasonableness obviously goes beyond what is
required by market accountability alone. Market accountability requires only that we be informed about the options insurers give us
and about their record of performance. Accountability for reasonableness requires that we also have access to the reasons for the
insurer’s policies and decisions and, crucially, that these policies and
decisions be based on the kinds of reasons fair-minded people consider relevant to the challenge of providing high-quality care to all
within limited resources. Market accountability leaves it to the consumer to infer whether a managed care plan is committed to patientcentered care. Accountability for reasonableness requires the plan
to be explicit about its commitments.
Why insist on such a demanding standard in health care but not
in other industries?

Legitimacy And Reform
To be successful, the reforms proposed in such measures as the
president’s Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities must address a basic ethical question about moral authority that we call the
legitimacy problem: Why, or under what conditions, should we (the
public, patients, and clinicians) entrust moral authority to private
organizations, such as managed care plans, to make controversial
limit-setting decisions that fundamentally affect our welfare? Under
what conditions is legitimate authority not only established
(whether through implicit social contract or explicit public policy),

but maintained and justified?
The preamble to President Clinton’s Consumer Bill of Rights and
Responsibilities asserts that “costs matter” in the distribution of
health care. Indeed, all health care systems, here and abroad, face
this unsolved problem of distributive justice—namely, how to meet
competing claims on limited health care resources fairly in a population of insured patients. How much priority should be given to the
sickest patients? When do modest benefits for larger numbers outweigh significant benefits for a few? Should we seek “best outcomes” or allow more people to have fair chances at some benefits? 2
The legitimacy problem asks who has the moral authority to solve
these controversial moral problems on our behalf. Under what conditions should we cede that authority to private corporations?3

Ethical Limits Of Market Accountability
Market accountability reflects one approach to the problem of legitimacy: Consumers retain “moral authority” by making choices.
When consumers make informed choices among plans, they give
“informed consent” to the limits the plan imposes. Consumers need
not know why plans set the limits they do, any more than they need
to know why car or computer manufacturers make the design decisions they make. If the limits set by plans are clear enough, there is
no doubt about what consumers have authorized.
The strong demand in current reforms for full disclosure of information to consumers reflects this conception of market accountability and legitimacy. Disclosure is demanded of the health plan’s
structure and provider network, down to names and credentials of
its physicians; the coverage provided and excluded; the capitation
schemes and other reimbursement methods used; members’ costsharing requirements; procedures for utilization management and
for the coverage of investigational treatments; formulary restrictions
and rules; disenrollment data; procedures for obtaining emergency
and out-of-network care; information about regulatory agencies; reporting on measures of performance; and loss ratios.
In theory, all of this information can help consumers to choose
plans that better meet their needs. For example, people who know
their family medical histories may anticipate that they will be better
served by one provider network than another, or by one set of rules
rather than another for using out-of-network treatments. Whether
people assimilate and act on this information is, however, an empirical question.
These principles requiring disclosure of information are justifiable on relatively uncontroversial grounds rooted in market theory.
No one should have to buy a pig in a poke. The required information

would—if all could act on it—lead to a more efficient market.
The fact that legitimacy requires consent and consent comes
through actual informed choice shows the key limits of this view.
First, there is a problem of system design: Nearly half of American
workers have no choice of plans, because their employers choose for
them. If there is no choice, then by the theory’s own lights, there is
no legitimacy, since consumers retain no moral authority. (Accordingly, one of the Principles of Consumer Protection rather lamely
insists that all individuals should be given a choice of plans; that
requirement was to have been a feature of the 1993 Clinton health
plan.)
Second, the enormous uncertainty that surrounds health care is
different from that involved in the purchase of other goods.4 We
have better information about what our computer or automobile
“needs” are and how to match them to appropriate computers or
cars than we do about our health needs and how to match them to
appropriate plans, clinicians, or treatments. This information problem makes our ongoing, interactive relationship with clinicians we
can trust crucial to health care delivery but not to car buying. System design and uncertainty combine: When a plan turns out not to
meet our newly discovered health care needs, our “preexisting condition” may make us unwelcome in another one, or we may be too
urgently ill to shop around, whereas if we buy a car or computer that
no longer meets our needs, we can sell it and buy another without
serious impact on our well-being.
Perhaps most important of all, if the computer market fails to
provide us with machines that meet all of our information managing
needs, that is too bad, but no injustice is done. But if health plans fail
to meet our needs fairly under necessary resource constraints, an
injustice is done. It violates a societal obligation to provide appropriate care for those needs.5 There is simply no way to hold plans
accountable for their role in meeting that societal obligation and to
ensure that the insurance market offers reasonable coverage and
treatment choices, unless we insist on accountability for making
reasonable decisions.
In short, those for whom choice is not possible at all, or for whom
the market provides no appropriate, reasonable choices, can complain that market accountability does not assure the legitimacy of
the limits they face.

Accountability For Reasonableness In Practice
Before saying more about its bearing on legitimacy, we emphasize
that accountability for reasonableness is not merely a utopian idea.
Elements of such accountability are already a practical, if not systematic and explicit, goal of some current reforms.
n Current reforms. The reform documents mentioned earlier
and legislative proposals based on them both supplement market
accountability with accountability for reasonableness when they
call for a “prudent layperson” standard for emergency care. This
standard stipulates that plans should provide coverage for services
whenever the member goes to an emergency room “with symptoms
(including severe pain) that a prudent layperson would reasonably
believe to be an emergency medical condition.”
Market accountability alone does not justify this requirement
about the nature of limitations on emergency coverage. Market accountability would simply require plans to disclose their emergency
coverage policies. Then it would let consumer preferences do the
work of weeding out unpopular restrictions. Accountability for reasonableness, in contrast, justifies the “prudent layperson” standard.
Obviously, insurers must take steps that result in more appropriate,
cost-effective uses of emergency department resources. It is unreasonable, however, whatever some plan managers may have thought,
to place the full risk-taking burden on prudent patients who believe
in good faith that they are in an emergency situation. Of course,
especially with hindsight, experts can weed out instances of decisions to go to emergency departments that do not reflect true emergencies. But plan managers seeking rules that they can justify to
consumers must realize that fair-minded consumers, who accept the
need for reasonable limits, would never agree that such stringent
cost-effectiveness standards should outweigh their good-faith concerns about serious risks to life or health. (Consumers might be
forced, through limited options, to “choose” a plan that does not
meet the prudent layperson standard, but such a forced choice is not
the kind of consent that preserves moral authority.)
Other features of the Principles for Consumer Protection also
reflect an implicit appeal to accountability for reasonableness. Consider, for example, the requirements that providers, including specialists, be reasonably accessible to patients, that continuity of care
be adequately planned for, and that formulary exceptions be made
when medical necessity requires it. All of these principles, vague as
they are, implicitly reject as unreasonable more restrictive decisions
about how to limit care because such restrictions would ignore
considerations that fair-minded patients and clinicians think are

relevant to meeting patients’ needs under necessary resource constraints. If fair-minded patients and clinicians cannot agree to these
limits, then fair-minded managers cannot either, since each party
must seek limits justifiable to others with whom they cooperate in
the health care game. Excluding these limits on care cannot be explained by an appeal to market accountability alone, since market
accountability would simply let informed consumers choose the
level and quality of care they prefer.
The principle governing coverage exclusions for experimental
technologies also takes an important step beyond market accountability toward accountability for reasonableness. It not only requires organizations to establish a technology assessment procedure (already required by NCQA standards) but also requires them
to institute an external, independent review process in cases of
disputed denials of coverage where the condition has a high probability of causing death within two years. The independent review is
one important way to assure patients (at least after the fact) that the
reasoning employed by a plan in making a decision is not unduly
vulnerable to distortion through conflict of interest. Market accountability, in contrast, requires only that a description of the
decision-making process, not an independent review, be available to
consumers.
n NCQA standards. NCQA standards and performance measures, which are primarily intended to provide for market accountability by assuring large-scale purchasers that “accredited” organizations meet rigorous quality standards, also show an implicit
recognition of accountability for reasonableness. For example, in
providing an explanation (on its Web site) of its utilization management (UM) standards, the NCQA captures their overall spirit with
these questions: “Does the Plan use a reasonable and consistent
process when deciding what health services are appropriate for individual’s needs? When the Plan denies payment for services, does it
respond to member and physician appeals?” In its rationale for the
standard (UM1) that requires clearly defined utilization management structures, procedures, and responsibilities, the NCQA says,
“A well-functioning UM program manages the use of limited resources to maximize the effectiveness of the care provided to the
member. By defining how utilization decisions are made, a wellstructured UM program promotes fair and consistent UM decision
making.”
Quite correctly, the NCQA recognizes that fairness and consistency must be demonstrable to members. In its rationale for the
standard (UM2) that requires publicly available utilization review
decision criteria based on sound clinical evidence, the NCQA says:

The managed care organization must be able to demonstrate to members and practitioners that UM decisions are made in a fair, impartial, and consistent manner that
serves the best interests of the members. Therefore, the managed care organization
has objective, measurable UM decision-making criteria that are based on reasonable
medical evidence.

Specifically, decisions must be consistent with clinical practice
guidelines where they have been introduced, and they must be available and understandable to clinicians. At the same time, such guidelines cannot be viewed as “absolute” criteria and must allow for
variation among patients (UM5). Fair-minded people would agree
to the limits imposed by clinical guidelines only if allowance were
made for the specific features of individual cases.
The rationale for the NCQA standard that concerns appeals procedures (UM6) explains that “accountability” for its decisions
means that a managed care plan that denies coverage must “clearly
explain the reasons for the denial to the member if the member was
involved in the UM process, as well as to the practitioner, as appropriate. The inclusion of the reason for a denial allows the member and/or
practitioner to understand the reasoning behind the managed care organization’s
decision” (emphasis added). In sum, members and practitioners affected by a denial of coverage are directly owed accountability for a
full explanation of the rationale for the decision.

Accountability For Reasonableness And
Legitimacy For Managed Care Plans
The consumer-driven reforms we have noted take important steps
beyond market accountability toward accountability for reasonableness. We propose four conditions that provide coherence and
direction to further reforms aimed at accountability for reasonableness.6 If met, they should, over time, lead enrollees, patients, and the
public to respect managed care plans’ decision making for its fairness and legitimacy. (1) Publicity condition: Decisions regarding
coverage for new technologies (and other limit-setting decisions)
and their rationales must be publicly accessible. (2) Relevance condition: These rationales must rest on evidence, reasons, and principles that all fair-minded parties (managers, clinicians, patients, and
consumers in general) can agree are relevant to deciding how to
meet the diverse needs of a covered population under necessary
resource constraints. (3) Appeals condition: There is a mechanism
for challenge and dispute resolution regarding limit-setting decisions, including the opportunity for revising decisions in light of
further evidence or arguments. (4) Enforcement condition: There is
either voluntary or public regulation of the process to ensure that
the first three conditions are met.

“Although the plans we studied engaged in a careful process, they
failed to make the rationales for their decisions accessible.”

H E A L T H

The guiding idea behind these four conditions is to convert private managed care plans’ solutions to problems of limit setting—
where, we have seen, highly controversial moral issues are at
stake—into part of a larger public deliberation about a major, unsolved public policy problem: namely, how to use limited resources
fairly to promote the health of a population with varied needs. In the
market view, moral authority remains in the hands of individual
consumers who confer legitimacy on plan limits with their contractual choices. In our view, because of the limits of the market view
and the moral importance of distributing health care fairly, ultimate
moral authority rests with the public. Just as market accountability
is a precondition for the exercise of individual market choice, so too
accountability for reasonableness is a precondition for the proper
exercise of democratic authority and a precondition for responsibly
seeking the flexibility, creativity, and efficiency that may result from
conferring legitimacy on health plans to set limits.
Meeting the four conditions converts accountability into a process of interactive education among all parties. A culture of openness
and reasonableness about rationales would facilitate learning on the
parts of clinicians and enrollees about the need for limits. It is often
said that we are a culture in which the litigious public will accept no
limits. To change that culture requires a concerted effort at education, and education requires openness about the rationales for managed care plans’ decisions.
These conditions help private institutions to enable or empower
a more focused public deliberation that would involve regulation,
legislation, courts, and electoral process. These conditions put us on
a learning curve that will permit cultural change both inside and
outside the institutions that must make and implement decisions
about limits.
n Rationale for the publicity and relevance conditions. The
publicity condition addresses a problem we discovered in our study
of how managed care organizations make decisions about coverage
for new technologies.7 Although the plans we studied generally engaged in a careful and thoughtful process that any observer would
agree was based on appropriate types of reasons, they failed to make
the rationales for their decisions publicly accessible. Specifically,
coverage decisions often are not “yes” or “no” but “mini-guidelines”
that involve patient selection criteria and deliberation about how to

ensure quality and cost worthiness when the treatment is administered. Patients who do not meet these coverage criteria should know
why their exclusion is reasonable.
The publicity condition thus provides a public record of the commitments to which the plan adheres in making these kinds of decisions. A case-law record such as this improves fairness in decision
making because it provides a basis for judging the coherence and
consistency of decisions made over time. It gives those affected by
decisions—often when they have no real choice to seek alternatives—a way of knowing why they face the restrictions they do. The
publicity condition thus satisfies what many believe is a basic requirement of justice: The grounds for decisions that fundamentally
affect our well being must be made publicly available to us.
The relevance condition imposes important constraints on the
kinds of reasons that should play a role in rationales for coverage
decisions, thereby narrowing the range of disagreement. The basic
idea is that fair-minded parties in a managed care plan pursue a
common goal or common good: In their health care game they agree
to pursue their diverse needs on terms they can justify to each other.
Since hard choices will have to be made about how to meet those
needs fairly, the grounds for those decisions must be ones that fairminded people can agree are relevant to that kind of decision.
Even if it narrows the range of disagreement, the relevance condition obviously does not mean that all parties will agree with the
specific decisions made. Parties may agree that reasons are relevant
but still give different weight or importance to them. As long as
fair-minded parties who make the decision and those who are affected by it can accept that the grounds for it are relevant, however,
then even those who say that the specific outcome is wrong must
admit that it is a case of reasonable disagreement. Achieving this
basis for cooperation is an important gain over the current situation,
where patients or clinicians readily—and often correctly—insist
that decisions are made on grounds other than meeting their needs
fairly under resource constraints.
Fair-minded people should accept many kinds of evidence and
reasons as relevant to coverage decisions. These include scientific
evidence about effectiveness and safety. In some cases, evidence
about cost-effectiveness also will be uncontroversial, as when there
is a less costly way to deliver an equal or superior benefit. Controversy about cost-effectiveness enters when we must trade away
some achievable benefits for a group of patients to achieve greater
cost-effectiveness. In these cases, reasons and principles that are
used to justify the judgment that a more cost-effective therapy
should be used must be carefully explicated. The situation is even

more controversial when the cost-effectiveness comparison involves
treatments for different groups of patients with different conditions. We found no evidence in our study, however, that new technologies were evaluated as competitors within an overall budget. All
evaluations were made primarily on the basis of safety and efficacy,
and costs entered the discussion only in thinking about how to
manage the delivery of the new treatment. If budget-driven, comparative judgments do become part of the coverage process—as
eventually they must—then even more attention will have to be paid
to the reasoning about distributive fairness in these cases.
Although our market-driven health care system depends on competition as a central mechanism, the situation is especially controversial when the continued competitiveness or profitability of a
health plan is the issue regarding cost. We do not rule out the
relevance of this kind of reason, at least in principle. Fair-minded
patients and clinicians would accept competition and profitability
as relevant kinds of reasons only if they could be persuaded that a
system of competing, private health plans actually makes no people
worse off than they need be and improves the outcomes for others.
If, however, the system simply produces advantages for some (say,
stockholders in a for-profit managed care plan) and imposes disadvantages on others (patients), then fair-minded people would not
accept the appeal to profitability.
Although “cost” considerations that are ultimately claims about
competitiveness or profitability may in principle be relevant reasons
for limits, in practice they will probably prove to be highly controversial and contested. For good business reasons, managed care
plans might not want to reveal the information necessary to prove
their relevance. In general, supporting these reasons requires information that is often not available, that is difficult to understand
when it is available, and that ultimately depends on fundamental
moral and political judgments about the feasibility of quite different
alternative systems of delivering care. Thus, these reasons are likely
to fuel rather than resolve disagreement. Unless managed care plans
build up credit over time by adhering to the conditions we outline
and establishing a record of demonstrated commitment to “the common good,” their appeal to rationales involving market position will
only deepen the suspicion of patients, clinicians, and the public.
n What about consumer participation? One response to the
failure of market accountability is to propose that consumers be
involved in decision making about coverage and other limit-setting
decisions. 8 We agree that some forms of consumer participation
might improve deliberation about some issues. We also think that at
least some organizations might be willing to experiment with forms

of consumer participation. Although we support the concept of
consumer participation, we believe that it is neither a necessary nor
a sufficient condition for ensuring accountability for reasonableness
or for establishing the legitimacy of managed care plans’ decisions.
Consumer participation is not necessary because the conditions
we advocate would by themselves establish when decisions are reasonable in the relevant sense. Consumer participation might improve deliberation about some matters, but it is unlikely that we
could ever enlist active enough consumer participation to deliberate
about limit setting in the many contexts where managed care plans
must make such decisions. Simply being accountable to a “board”
containing consumer representatives would not ensure that the
right sort of deliberation took place at appropriate levels in the plan.
In addition, there is no realistic mechanism for making consumers
who participate truly representative of the consumer population as
a whole, especially when we are concerned with private organizations, including for-profit systems.
Managed care plan deliberation that meets the four conditions
does not substitute for any public democratic process, such as legislative or executive branch deliberation. Rather, it facilitates that
process. The four conditions compel plans to contribute their deliberative capacities to whatever broader public deliberation is conducted through democratic institutions, formally or informally. The
four conditions provide connective tissue to, not a replacement for,
a broader democratic process. Ultimately, these broader processes
have moral authority and responsibility for guaranteeing the fairness of limit-setting decisions.

Implementing Accountability For Reasonableness
Do health plans have any incentive to implement accountability for
reasonableness? Greater clarity about rationales can make decision
making more coherent and efficient. In addition, some plans might
be able to “market” their accountability for reasonableness to competitive advantage. However, the main incentive for this change is
that the current system is broken, and a distrustful public has already been driven to try to fix it with legislated regulations. Our
proposal is a way for plans to seize the initiative on regaining trust.
Are we simply calling for bureaucratic triviality? No doubt, the
idea could be turned into a meaningless bureaucratic requirement,
but the cultural change we seek is not an appeal for make-work
paper pushing.
Is it cost escalating? We believe that conflict reduction (the ultimate aim of our approach) will ultimately reduce costs. The Henry J.

study of the Clinton bill of consumer rights that showed the cost of
implementation for four of its key rights was only $31 per family,
contrary to managed care plans’ claims of high cost. 9
Is it real change or only a patina of fairness? The accountability we
call for would be a real change. Its effects on resource allocation will
emerge when we understand better the reasons for current decisions.
Will it affect the decisions of the “real” players—the large purchasers? Purchasers complain that they want to act on good information about performance but lack a way to do so. Accountability
for reasonableness adds to the tools for assessing performance and
will produce greater public understanding of how all players make
decisions.
Here are some specific suggestions about implementation.
n NCQA standards. Earlier, we noted that accountability for
reasonableness was already an element in the NCQA rationales for
some of its standards for utilization management and appeals. To
make accountability for reasonableness a more explicit requirement,
we have proposed to the NCQA that it modify the standards for
technology assessment to require organizations to (1) make rationales for their coverage decisions publicly available and (2) demonstrate that these decisions are based on evidence, reasons, and principles that address meeting patients’ needs under reasonable
resource constraints. Other standards could be similarly strengthened to support accountability for reasonableness. The result would
be to use accreditation as a way to promote a culture of openness in
managed care plans about the rationales for limit-setting decisions
of all kinds.
n Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. If the preamble to Clinton’s Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities called
more explicitly for accountability for reasonableness, it would
strengthen some of the proposed rights. For example, the “right to
participate in treatment decisions” requires access to the rationales
that justify limits on available options, including coverage for unproven but promising technologies. The culture of openness and
reasonableness that would result from meeting our four conditions
supports the widely held goal of collaborative decision making
among patients and clinicians.
In the statement of consumer responsibilities, we are told that a
consumer is responsible to “be aware of a health care provider’s
obligation to be reasonably efficient and equitable in providing care
to other patients and the community.” There is no way to exercise
that responsibility, however, unless the managed care plan is publicly accountable for the reasonableness of its limit-setting deciA F F A I R S

sions. Consumers cannot tell if the plan is being “reasonably efficient and equitable” if they do not have access to the rationales for
decisions that are made about limits.
n Legislative initiatives at the state level. Forty-four states
made proposals for managed care regulation in 1996. Many regulations call for very specific coverage mandates—what has been called
“organ-by-organ health care reform.” The net effect of these sorts of
mandates is to reinforce the idea that managed care plans are not to
be trusted and cannot be legitimate authorities for making responsible limit-setting decisions. In contrast, our proposal is that the legislative reform should concentrate on process-focused regulation
that aims for both market accountability and accountability for reasonableness. Such process-oriented reforms create the conditions
under which plans can establish a visible track record of reasonable
decision making. For example, the Friedman-Knowles legislation in
California provides a model for defusing fears of conflict of interest
in the case of “last-chance” experimental treatments and is far superior to mandating coverage for specific unproven therapies, as happened with bone marrow transplants for breast cancer.10

Legitimacy: Not Simply A Market Problem
The legitimacy and fairness problems that face our private health
delivery organizations, such as managed care plans, have their analogues in public (universal coverage) systems such as the National
Health Service in Great Britain and the Canadian single-payer system. At one level, the legitimacy problem in those systems has a
clearer answer. The public agencies that set limits are publicly accountable in the sense that they are ultimately under democratic
recall. Nevertheless, much of what we have said here about explicit
reason giving and accountability, as well as about mechanisms for
appeal and dispute resolution, carries over to these public systems
as well. 11 In these systems accountability is often hidden in the black
box of “budget” decisions.
In addition to its relevance from the broader international perspective, accountability for reasonableness is also important at the level of
the individual patient/physician relationship. It creates a climate that
empowers patients and physicians in collaborative decision making.
Patients and clinicians advocating for the use of promising but unproven technology need to know why the technology is not covered.
Without access to the rationale for decisions, including the evidence,
analysis of risks and benefits, and reasons for any patient selection
criteria, collaborative treatment planning is undermined.
The conditions we describe for addressing the legitimacy and
fairness problems apply to public as well as private delivery instituH E A L T H

tions (whether or not they include universal coverage). All such
institutions have an opportunity to enhance or diminish their credentials for fair decision making about such fundamental matters
every time they make such decisions. Whether in public or mixed
systems, establishing the accountability of decisionmakers to those
affected by their decisions is the only way to show, over time, that
arguably fair decisions are being made and that those making them
have established a procedure we should view as legitimate. Even if
direct public participation is not an essential ingredient of the process in either public or mixed systems, accountability to the public
for reasonableness is necessary to facilitate the broader democratic
processes that regulate the system.
