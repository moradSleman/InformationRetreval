Video Games in Job Interviews: Using Algorithms to Minimize
Discrimination and Unconscious Bias
Introduction
On a summer day in 2002, Billy Beane sat in a roomful of baseball scouts trying to create a list of high
school and college athletes his team hoped to draft seven days later.1 Beane, in his fifth year as
general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a Major League Baseball team, grew tired of the players
his scouts suggested, most of whom never reached the major leagues.2 He decided that comments
from his scouts about players, such as "[t]here might be some family issues here I heard the dad
had spent some time in prison"3 or "[t]his kid wears a large pair of underwear [a] body like that can
be low energy4 [i]t's not natural,"5 were not the qualities scouts should consider when selecting a
player to draft.6 Beane wanted to analyze the players' statistics.7 He wanted to know which players
hit the ball, drew the most walks, and struck out hitters most often.8 Beane hired Paul DePodesta, a
Harvard graduate, to analyze statistics using algorithms to calculate who performed best on the field.9
Using algorithms focused on performance to make operational decisions throughout the 2002 season,
Beane replaced the best players Oakland lost in free agency with unknown or overlooked players and
made the playoffs with one of the league's lowest payrolls.10
Beane's bold and unprecedented use of algorithms to evaluate baseball players set an example for
objectively identifying the best talent within a large pool while saving money.11 Employers have
achieved similar success using algorithms to select employees.12 For many years, companies used
computerized résumé-tracking systems based on algorithms to scan résumés for key words or
phrases important for the job.13 Some companies use algorithms in more sophisticated ways. Some
have applicants take quizzes or play games to assess qualities, including cognitive abilities, work
ethic, problem-solving skills, and motivation, that cannot be seen from a résumé.14 These employers
can winnow from thousands of applicants those most likely to perform the best and stay the
longest.15
Although analyzing game or quiz performance with algorithms seems like an objective means to
evaluate applicants, some say the practice16 may lead to disparate treatment17 and disparate
impact18 discrimination violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 196419 and the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act (ADEA).20 Critics express concern that algorithms, often derived from information
about current employees, will discriminate against underrepresented groups if existing employees do
not proportionately represent the applicant pool.21 For example, use of a video game to screen
applicants may disadvantage older applicants if they do not perform as well as millennials.22 Further,
algorithms may not prevent unconscious bias from affecting employers' hiring practices.23
However, carefully designed and periodically evaluated algorithms can avoid disparate treatment and
disparate impact discrimination and avoid unconscious bias.24 This Article argues that despite the
fear that algorithms will cause employment discrimination, a study of video game use in the hiring
process shows that it provides better and fairer ways to evaluate applicants without discrimination.
Part I describes how algorithms have been utilized in hiring and provides details about two video
games, "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom," used to evaluate applicants. Part II examines the
debate over whether algorithms, and particularly their use in video games, cause hiring discrimination.
Finally, Part III discusses how the use of "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom" can achieve greater
success than human evaluations in both avoiding disparate impact and disparate treatment claims
and reducing unconscious bias in employee selection.
I. Background
Workers today, especially millennials, no longer envision spending an entire career at one
company.25 Although the average number of applicants per job has remained low, some companies
receive large quantities of applications for certain openings.26 Many of these companies have looked
to algorithm-based résumé-tracking systems to help sort and evaluate applicants.27 Widely used
résumé-tracking systems, however, have limitations that have led some companies to use algorithmbased video games to identify whether applicants possess desired qualifications.28

A. Job Market Changes Have Led to Large Numbers of Job Applicants
Millennials (born between 1980 and 1996) move more freely between jobs than any other
generation.29 A 2016 Gallup poll showed that twenty-one percent of millennials had changed jobs
within the last year, three times more than non-millennials.30 Sixty percent of millennials were open to
a different job opportunity, compared to forty-five percent of non-millennials.31 On average,
millennials switch jobs every two years for a number of reasons, including better job opportunities, low
workplace engagement, and the absence of a compelling reason to stay in a current position.32
Before the Internet was in widespread use, those seeking employment were limited to information
from published newspaper and magazine notices and referrals from family and friends.33 Now, the
Internet facilitates casual and efficient nationwide job searches.34 For example, the popular job
search website, LinkedIn, has 400 million users and includes a job search tool connecting job seekers
with posted employer vacancies.35 LinkedIn's "apply now" button can transmit job seekers' profiles
directly to potential employers.36
Job search engines have significantly increased the number of job applicants.37 On average, 118
people apply for a single job posting.38 Some companies are overwhelmed by the number of
applicants.39 In 2011, Starbucks received 7.6 million job applications for 65,000 corporate and retail
job openings, and one million people applied for 2,000 positions at Proctor & Gamble.40 Goldman
Sachs received 250,000 job applications from millennials for 2016 summer positions.41 Companies
facing the tall task of screening so many applicants have used algorithm-based tools to identify
efficiently the far smaller number of candidates appropriate for a manager's review.42
B. Algorithms Incorporated into the Job Hiring Process
Originally, algorithm-based tools were very basic.43 Résumé-tracking systems could scan résumés
for pre-selected key words and phrases to identify résumés to be reviewed by human eyes.44
However, these systems improved over time.45 They now do more than identify key words and
phrases.46 Contemporary tracking systems have four steps.47 First, the system removes all résumé
styling and separates the text into recognized words and phrases.48 Second, it sorts these words and
phrases into specific categories, such as education, contact information, skills, and work
experience.49 Third, it matches the employers' desired keywords against the résumé's words and
phrases.50 Fourth, it scores the résumé on a relevancy scale representing the applicant's value to the
employer.51 Résumés of candidates with sufficiently high scores are then reviewed by a human.52
The ability of résumé-tracking systems to sort quickly through thousands of applications has led to its
wide adoption by both large and small companies nationwide, including over 90% of Fortune 500
companies.53
Résumé-tracking systems have weaknesses, however. On average, a résumé-tracking system
decreases applicants' chances of obtaining a job interview by 75% if they fail to include key words or
phrases, regardless of their qualifications.54 Thus, highly qualified applicants who omit selected key
words or phrases may be eliminated.55 Also, résumé-tracking systems consider only some elements
of a candidate's qualifications. They might, for example, include education, work experience, contact
information, and skills.56 They do not assess cognitive abilities, work ethic, problem-solving skills, or
motivation.57 Because experts believe these additional factors best predict workplace success, newer
tools use algorithms to analyze these qualities.58 These tools often take the form of online quizzes or
games that can make detailed personality assessments that can efficiently identify the most promising
candidates.59
C. Video Game Algorithms
In March 2016, eight percent of U.S. companies used predictive analytics involving algorithms.60
Many of these companies use video games to obtain and analyze data from a large number of
applicants to find candidates having the company's desired abilities and personality traits.61 The data
to be analyzed are tailored to the particular job and assess such qualities as "how creative, cautious,
adept at multitasking or easily distracted, among other attributes, potential job applicants are."62

"Wasabi Waiter," developed by Knack,63 and "Firefly Freedom," used by Deloitte,64 are examples of
such games.
"Wasabi Waiter" places the applicant in the role of a server at a sushi restaurant who must decide
which dishes to recommend to customers.65 The game's designer, Guy Halfteck, explains:
The player has to engage in multiple micro-decisions, think about prioritizing, about [the] sequence of
taking actions, about persisting when the game becomes more challenging . The game collects all
the data points about the entirety of the behavior during the game . Then we analyze that data to
extract insight into the intellectual and personal makeup of that person."66
"Firefly Freedom" takes place in a forest world where applicants must catch fireflies to provide light for
a family during the winter.67 The applicant fires pieces of fruit at a jar to release fireflies trapped
inside. 68 However, one of the ten pieces of fruit will smash the jar, letting all fireflies escape,
reducing the applicant's score to zero.69 The game tests whether applicants will quit while ahead or
risk losing everything to get more fireflies.70 Statistics compiled from this game analyze applicants'
risk appetite, mental agility, and persistence.71
II. The Debate over Whether Algorithms Discriminate
Algorithms' growing use in hiring raises the question of whether they result in discrimination.72 Some
contend algorithms invite discrimination because their creators rely, in building their formulas, on past
hiring decisions that may have been discriminatory.73 Video game algorithms, in particular, may
cause age discrimination if younger applicants' experience playing video games disadvantages older
candidates.74 However, the gap between age groups' performance on video games is not as wide as
some might assume.75 Legal scholars have suggested that disparate treatment and disparate impact
law is ineffective in responding to algorithms.76 However, proponents explain that cost-effective
algorithms can be designed to avoid discrimination.77
A. The Argument That Algorithms Discriminate
Both legal scholars and the media are concerned that using algorithms in hiring causes
discrimination.78 Much of this concern arises from a 2014 White House report warning that algorithms
could allow companies to discriminate against certain groups, including minorities and low-income
persons.79 Such discrimination can be built into algorithms under the guise of statistical
assessment.80 Algorithm creators rely on employers' past hiring data to build predictive formulas to
match their best workers' traits with job applicants' data.81 If a company has not historically hired
people from a particular racial or ethnic group, its algorithm will systematically exclude such people
from consideration.82 For example, Silicon Valley has long been criticized for its white-maledominated workplaces.83 Algorithms based on such existing workforce demographics may not
advance employee diversity.84
Video games such as "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom" generate fear that older applicants will
be systematically excluded.85 While many millennials are accustomed to playing video games and
may not mind playing one in the initial job hiring process, older persons less familiar with video games
might struggle.86 Video games test characteristics such as response time, attention to detail, levels of
emotion, and responsiveness.87 Millennials may perform better than older applicants at these games
and may score higher on the desired characteristics.88
Rejected candidates may seek to challenge use of algorithm-based games as discriminatory.89
However, legal scholars realize that it would be hard for plaintiffs to prove disparate treatment or
impact claims under Title VII's existing framework.90 Algorithms analyze vast amounts of information,
making it unlikely that an employer would intentionally alter each calculation to treat a protected class
disparately.91 Disparate impact claims are also unlikely to prevail.92 Successful plaintiffs would have
to identify the exact algorithm that discriminated against a specific group--a difficult task because of
the complexity of algorithmic design.93 Even if plaintiffs sought to prove the algorithm as a whole
resulted in discrimination, they would need to engage in costly discovery to learn how applicants in
the targeted group were denied employment by the algorithm.94

Some legal scholars have sought alternatives to address algorithm-caused discrimination.95 For
example, in her article, Data-Driven Discrimination at Work, Pauline T. Kim, a law professor at
Washington University in St. Louis, argues that the rigid framework of Title VII should be broadened to
disallow what she calls "classification bias."96 Kim defines "classification bias" as "the use of
classification schemes that have the effect of exacerbating inequality or disadvantage along lines of
race, sex or other protected characteristics."97 Instead of requiring plaintiffs to identify the biased
algorithm causing discrimination, Kim would require employers to prove that data created by their
algorithms are accurate and do not discriminate against any group.98
B. The Argument That Algorithms Do Not Discriminate
Algorithms' proponents contend that algorithms can be effective, non-discriminatory job performance
predictors.99 Algorithm-based video games allow companies to lower the costs of initial hiring
process stages, which can run as high as $3,000 for each new employee.100 They also enable
employers to identify quickly the most qualified applicants among large numbers of candidates.101
While applicants often have equal or similar résumé content, algorithm-based tests allow employers
to see which have qualifications not revealed by paper documents.102
Algorithm supporters challenge the White House's conclusion that algorithms will likely
discriminate.103 Algorithm creators are aware that their formulas risk unintentional discrimination, so
they seek to eliminate potentially discriminatory factors. For example, Evolv, a San Francisco start-up
company that creates hiring algorithms, omits the distance between applicants' homes and the
employer's location, even though data show that workers with longer commutes are more likely to
quit.104 Evolv knows that because racial and ethnic communities are often geographically
segregated, considering residence location risks discrimination.105 Monitoring results can identify
disparities and periodic updates can eliminate potential unfairness toward any group.106
Video game proponents similarly argue that games are superior to résumés for assessing job-relevant
qualities and skills.107 As Knack's founder, Guy Halfteck, explains: "Traditional scores only look at
written test abilities. They do not begin to measure the factors likely to have most bearing on your
success: social skills or personality traits--how you deal with stress, how you collaborate with people,
how much you listen ."108 Halfteck assures skeptics that games do not discriminate based on age
because people of all ages play mobile games like "Wasabi Waiter" well.109
III. Analysis
Critics of algorithm-based hiring correctly identify algorithms' potential for hiring discrimination.110 If
algorithms intentionally disadvantage certain types of applicants or eliminate a group from
consideration they would constitute illegal disparate treatment.111 Algorithms can also unintentionally
cause disparate impact discrimination.112 As with any type of employment hiring practice,
discrimination may occur if proper precautions are not taken. However, algorithms should not be
presumptively viewed in such negative light. Used properly, algorithms can evaluate job applicants
more fairly than face-to-face employer-applicant interviews. Specifically, video games such as
"Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom" assess applicants in the initial hiring process in a less
discriminatory way.
A. How "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom" Evaluate Applicants
While not applied specifically to hiring, an experiment in which people were asked to play "Wasabi
Waiter" identified the best employee ideas without discriminating.113 Hans Haringa, an executive in
Royal Dutch Shell's GameChanger unit, was interested in whether "Wasabi Waiter" could help identify
people who would offer potentially disruptive business ideas, that is, those with outside-the-box
workplace creativity.114 The unit "solicit[s] ideas promiscuously from inside and outside the company,
and then play[s] the role of venture capitalists, vetting each idea, meeting with its proponents,
dispensing modest seed funding to a few promising candidates, and monitoring their progress."115
The unit's process generally succeeds in finding these sources of creativity, but the process takes
more than two years and less than ten percent of ideas warrant the unit's further research and
development.116 With Knack's help, Haringa conducted an experiment to see if the same results
could be reached more quickly.117

Using a database of all the ideas GameChanger had received over several years, Haringa asked
1,400 idea contributors to play two of Knack's video games, one of which was "Wasabi Waiter."118
Haringa informed Knack how well three-fourths of these idea generators had done in identifying
business ideas, and Knack used the gameplay data of these contributors to create gameplay profiles
comparing strong and weak idea contributors.119 Knack analyzed the remaining idea contributors to
predict which had done best at identifying disruptive business ideas.120 Without knowing any
identifying information about contributors, including class or classification characteristics, Knack
correctly identified the top ten percent of successful idea generators.121 This identification was based
only on personal factors such as "'mind wandering' (or the tendency to follow interesting, unexpected
offshoots of the main task at hand, to see where they lead), social intelligence, 'goal-orientation
fluency,' implicit learning, task-switching ability, and conscientiousness."122
Deloitte, an accounting firm that provides "audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, tax,
and related services" to clients uses "Firefly Freedom" for non-discriminatory evaluation of interns.123
It uses "Firefly Freedom" to select people with a variety of backgrounds that have high potential for
success."124 Rob Davies, author of the article, Everything to Play for as Employers Turn to Video
Games in Recruitment Drive, played Deloitte's video game, and his experience shows how employers
can avoid discrimination.125 In addition to catching fireflies, the game also had simpler tests to
measure how quickly players tapped the screen and whether they remembered a color sequence.126
The game's designer, Arctic Shores, analyzed and reported to Davies the data from his twenty-eight
minutes of gameplay.127 The results showed Davies "'tend[ed] to be fairly motivated by tangible
rewards' '[was] as quick at learning new things as most people' and 'may not display either the
truly breakthrough thinking required for step-change, nor the extreme due diligence required in highstakes situations.'"128 Davies' experience playing "Fire-fly Freedom" demonstrates how Deloitte looks
only at personal performance qualities when evaluating interns rather than focusing on an applicant's
personal characteristics that can lead to discrimination.129
These examples show that "Firefly Freedom" and "Wasabi Waiter" can identify applicants with desired
qualities in a manner traditional hiring processes cannot duplicate. If used in smart, safe, and effective
ways, video games can reduce discrimination in hiring.
B. Video Games Can Avoid Disparate Treatment and Disparate Impact Discrimination
Some critics argue that plaintiffs cannot effectively litigate hiring discrimination caused by algorithms
under current law.130 Despite these claims, discriminatory algorithms can be effectively identified
using disparate treatment and disparate impact frameworks.131 A properly prepared attorney can
conduct necessary discovery and find appropriate expert witnesses to prove if algorithm-based
discrimination exists. Attorneys can also examine both the employer's algorithm itself and the data it
generates when sorting applications to determine if discrimination occurred. Neither of these glimpses
into discovering hiring discrimination is available when humans sort through résumés.132 Any hiring
practice, including algorithms, can be discriminatory because of intentional, reckless, or negligent
human behavior. However, if employers use algorithms intelligently, they can evaluate job applicants
using video games in a manner that reduces disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination.
It will be difficult to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment against an employer using
video games in hiring.133 Such employers have considered neither class nor classification of
applicants when analyzing candidate results.134 When employers collect gameplay data from
applicants, they send it to video game developers for analysis.135 Without considering any class or
classification (because no such information was acquired from game players), the developer analyzes
all data produced by its algorithms and identifies the most qualified candidates.136 Employers that
rely on these assessments do not consider applicants' class or classification under Title VII or the
ADEA because the algorithm did not collect such information. Rather, the process identifies
applicants with characteristics related to job success, such as emotional intelligence, cognitive skills,
working memory, and propensity for risk-taking, and the employer can select a small group from the
large pool of initial applicants for the next hiring process stage.137 The employer can even have the
developer select the smaller group of applicants based on these characteristics without the employer
being aware of any applicant's class or classification.138 If employers use algorithm-based video
games to evaluate job applicants without knowledge of protected classes, disparate treatment claims

are far less likely to arise than if a human evaluates job applicants with ready access to information
(such as physical address or first name) that may indicate race, sex, or another protected
characteristic.
Disparate impact claims, however, are still possible.139 Although algorithms analyze players' video
game statistics in "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom" neutrally, algorithms could unintentionally
discriminate against a protected class or classification140 in the absence of preventive actions to
avoid inclusion of discriminatory factors.141
Game developers have a company's best performers play a game to design algorithms to identify
applicants sharing the same workplace characteristics of successful employees.142 If a company
does not have a history of hiring a certain category of persons, particularly those from protected
classes, algorithms using past hiring data may systematically exclude this group from
consideration.143 However, when video game developers have the best workers play video games,
they do not consider the player's identity.144 The developers simply have the employee play the
game to identify personal characteristics of successful workplace performers, such as emotional
intelligence, cognitive skills, working memory, and propensity for risk-taking.145 Developers focus on
workplace characteristics of successful employees, not group identities of applicants.146 Although
results are preliminary, research suggests it is unlikely a protected group will perform worse than
other applicants in all relevant categories of workplace production.147
Research on one protected class tends to disprove one of the most common arguments that video
games will cause discrimination: video game algorithms will cause age discrimination because older
people who may not regularly play video games will perform worse than millennials.148 The argument
assumes that the traits video games test, including response time and attention to detail, will
decrease with age.149 However, a study conducted in 2014 undermines this expectation.150
Researchers at Simon Fraser University in Canada used video games to study the age at which
motor performance begins to decline.151 Persons aged sixteen to forty-four played a video game
called "StarCraft 2," and researchers analyzed their gameplay using several different statistical
analyses.152 "StarCraft 2" is more complex than, but similar to, "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly
Freedom." Its object is to defeat the opponent's army while managing the player's civilization and
military growth.153 The game is played in real time, so players must make split-second decisions and
conduct small actions to defeat the enemy.154 Researchers found that cognitive function, such as
reaction time, begins to decline at age twenty-four.155 However, even though older players had
slower reaction times, their gameplay did not suffer.156 Older players compensated for slower
reaction times by using simpler and more streamlined strategies.157 Basically, as reaction times
decreased, ability to utilize a better strategy increased.158 Age discrimination claims based on video
game applicant screening are not likely to be successful because even though reaction time
decreases with age, the ability to plan and employ an effective strategy increases.159
Companies that intelligently create and administer video games in initial hiring stages can accomplish
several purposes. Video games allow employers to select efficiently a small group from a large
number of candidates to interview and can decrease disparate treatment and disparate impact
discrimination. Video games can also reduce unconscious bias in evaluation of job candidates.
C. Video Games Can Reduce Unconscious Bias
Unconscious bias plays a role in human evaluation of job candidates.160 For example, "[m]anagers
often gravitate to people most like themselves, make gender-based assumptions about skills or
salaries, or reject candidates who have non-white names ."161 Having applicants playing video
games like "WasabiWaiter" and "Firefly Freedom" during the initial hiring process allows employers to
choose the best candidates without considering anyone's class or classification.162 Selected
candidates continue to the next stage of the hiring process without unconscious bias of human
decision-makers influencing selection.163 Although unconscious bias could arise during later
interviews, video games using algorithms can at least eliminate unconscious bias in the first stage.

Of course, unconscious bias could infect algorithm design.164 Algorithms can reproduce biases
inherent in their creators because creators determine which factors the algorithms will weigh.165
Additionally, if unconscious bias influences identification of job-related characteristics, candidate
selection will also be biased.166
While unconscious bias may influence both human hiring decisions and algorithms,167 precautions
can eliminate unconscious bias more effectively from algorithms than from human brains. Algorithms
designed by collecting multiple people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and biases can
identify and eliminate unconscious bias that could be present if designers worked individually.168
Computer scientists at the University of Utah, University of Arizona, and Haverford College
demonstrated this process.169 University of Utah Professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian led these
computer scientists in a project to create a method to avoid unconscious bias in algorithms.170 The
group designed two algorithms to work in tandem.171 The first algorithm incorporates the Title VII
disparate impact framework172 to test whether an algorithm is discriminatory.173 If proven
discriminatory, the second algorithm changes the data set to remove discriminatory effects.174
Developers can add this method to the existing precautions of "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom"
to limit the discriminatory effects of their algorithms.175 Running these video games algorithms
through the algorithms the computer scientists created could eliminate unconscious bias at a much
higher rate than humans trying to eliminate it from their behavior during hiring. Although algorithms
could cause discrimination, video games such as "Wasabi Waiter" and "Firefly Freedom," with
additional reviews for possible algorithm bias, are more effective at avoiding discrimination at preinterview stages of the hiring process than human review of applicants and résumés.176
Conclusion
To find the best job candidates out of thousands of applicants, some companies require applicants to
play video games that use algorithms to determine who could best perform the job.177 Some assert
that the use of algorithms in hiring can cause both disparate treatment and disparate impact
discrimination under Title VII and the ADEA and can reflect their creators' unconscious bias.178
Certainly, any practice not carefully designed, applied, and evaluated can cause workplace
discrimination.179 However, having applicants play video games such as "Wasabi Waiter" and
"Firefly Freedom" in initial hiring stages can facilitate nondiscriminatory evaluation of all
candidates.180 If employers take proper precautions, algorithms can more effectively avoid
unconscious bias than human assessment.181 Video games using algorithms to identify applicants
with characteristics that predict exceptional workplace performance can be a cost-effective alternative
to avoid the discriminatory potential of human evaluation.
