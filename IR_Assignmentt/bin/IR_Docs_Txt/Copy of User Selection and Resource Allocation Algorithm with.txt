User Selection and Resource Allocation Algorithm with
Fairness in MISO-OFDMA
Vasileios D. Papoutsis, Ioannis G. Fraimis, and Stavros A. Kotsopoulos

Abstract—The problem of user selection and resource allocation for the downlink of wireless systems operating over a
frequency-selective channel is investigated. It is assumed that the
Base Station (BS) uses many antennas, whereas a single antenna
is available to each user. A suboptimal, but efficient algorithm
is devised that is based on Zero Forcing (ZF) beamforming and
on spatial correlation. The algorithm maximizes the sum of the
users’ data rates subject to constraints on total available power
and proportional fairness among users’ data rates. The main
feature of it is the proportionality among users’ data rates which
is guaranteed as it is shown by simulations.

between the BS and user 𝑘 in subcarrier 𝑛. Thus, for each
subcarrier 𝑛, the baseband equivalent model for the system
can be written as
y𝑛 = H𝑛 x𝑛 + z𝑛 ,

FDMA is a scheme that helps exploit multiuser diversity in frequency-selective channels [1] while MIMO
technology offers significant increase in the data throughput
[2] without additional bandwidth or transmit power requirements. Zf technique has been proposed to remove co-channel
interuser interference [3]. By combining OFDMA with MIMO
transmission, wireless systems can offer larger system capacities and improved reliability.
In general, in order to transmit on the boundary of the
capacity region, the BS needs to transmit to multiple users
simultaneously in each subchannel employing Dirty Paper
Coding (DPC) [2]. However, DPC has large implementation
complexity. In [4]-[6], user selection and beamforming algorithms, that are based on ZF [3], are proposed in order
to maximize the system capacity without guaranteeing any
kind of fairness among the users’ data rates. In [7], a kind of
fairness is supported.
In this paper, a user selection and resource allocation algorithm for multiuser downlink MISO-OFDMA is developed
that incorporates fairness by imposing proportional constraints
[1] among the users’ data rates. The beamforming scheme of
[4] [6] is applied in each subcarrier but the user selection
procedure takes fairness into account.

where H𝑛 = [h1,𝑛 h2,𝑛 . . . h𝐾,𝑛 ]𝑇 is a 𝐾 × 𝑇 matrix with
complex entries, x𝑛 is the 𝑇 × 1 transmitted signal vector in
subcarrier 𝑛, y𝑛 is a 𝐾 × 1 vector containing the received
signal of each user, and z𝑛 is a 𝐾 × 1 noise vector.
The practically important case where 𝐾 ≥ 𝑇 is considered.
Hence, rank(H𝑛 ) = min(𝑇, 𝐾) = 𝑇 . The total transmitted
power is 𝑃𝑡𝑜𝑡 and equal power is allocated to each subcarrier.

𝑇 × 1 beamforming weight vector for user 𝑘 in subcarrier
𝑛. Then, the baseband model (1) can be written as y𝑛 =
H𝑛 W𝑛 D𝑛 s𝑛 + z𝑛 , where W𝑛 = [w1,𝑛 w2,𝑛 . . . w𝐾,𝑛 ]

diag( 𝑝1,𝑛 , 𝑝2,𝑛 , . . . , 𝑝𝐾,𝑛 ) is the power distribution to

Using ZF beamforming it is possible to encode users individually, and with smaller complexity compared to DPC [2].
If 𝐾 ≤ 𝑇 and rank(H𝑛 ) = 𝐾, the ZF beamforming matrix is
W𝑛 = H∗𝑛 (H𝑛 H∗𝑛 )−1 . However, if 𝐾 > 𝑇 , it is not possible
to use it because H𝑛 H∗𝑛 is singular. In that case it is necessary
to select 𝑡 ≤ 𝑇 out of 𝐾 users in each subcarrier. Hence,
there are 𝐼 possible combinations of users transmitting in the
same subcarrier denoted as 𝐴𝑖 , where 𝐴𝑖 ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , 𝐾},

used, the data rate of user 𝑘 ∈ 𝐴𝑖 in subcarrier 𝑛 is [2]

The problem above (3) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with non-linear constraints. The optimal
solution can be obtained by exhaustive search of all possible
user assignment sets in all subcarriers but the complexity
is given by 𝐼 𝑁 , which is extremely complicated even for
moderate 𝐾, 𝑁 . In the following, a suboptimal user selection
and resource allocation algorithm is proposed.

The algorithm finds user 𝑘 by calculating 𝑅
𝛾𝑘 , ∀𝑘 =
1, . . . , 𝐾 after each allocation. During the first iteration, when
all users have zero data rates any user can be chosen. Then,
𝑛 is chosen that maximizes the data rate of user 𝑘 if that user
were to transmit alone in that subcarrier. Additional users are
admitted to the subcarrier based on two criteria: 1) similar to
[4] [6], the sum data rate in the subcarrier should increase,
and 2) the newly admitted user 𝑠𝑡 can achieve “fair” sum data
rate compared to the sum data rate of the other users that have
already been admitted to the subcarrier, according to system
parameter 𝐷. The size of the set 𝒬 is set heuristically equal
to 𝐿 = min{𝒰, 𝑇 }, because it was shown to lead to good
performance in most simulated cases.

IV. S IMULATION R ESULTS
The proposed algorithm is compared with the algorithms
proposed in [4],[5],[7], Round Robin (RR) algorithm, and
Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) transmission, only to the
user with the strongest channel. In RR algorithm, each user
is given a fair share of the channel resource regardless of the
channel state and 𝑇 users are selected in each subcarrier. Both
equal power (EQ) allocation and water-filling (WF) power
allocation over the parallel subchannels are considered.
In all simulations presented in this section, the frequencyselective channel consists of six independent Rayleigh multipath components. As in [1], an exponentially decaying power
delay profile is assumed, the ratio of the energy of the 𝑙th tap to
the first tap being equal to 𝑒−2𝑙 . A maximum delay spread of
5𝜇s and maximum doppler of 30Hz is assumed. The channel
information is sampled every 0.5ms to update the proposed
algorithm, 𝑇 = 4, 𝑁 = 64, 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 = 15, and the number of
channel realizations is equal to 1000.
For each channel realization, 100 time samples are used for
each user and the available users are been assigned a set of
proportional constants {𝛾𝑘 }𝐾
𝑘=1 which follow the probability

In Fig. 1, the performance of the proposed algorithm is
shown for different values of system parameter 𝐷, when
𝐾 = 16. Fairness pointer indicates the maximum difference
between users’ data rates and respective fairness constraints,
namely max𝑘=1,...,𝐾 (𝑅𝑘 − 𝛾𝑘 ). It is shown that as the system
parameter becomes larger, the sum of the users’ data rates
becomes larger too, but the fairness criterion is more relaxed.
Thus, the system parameter indicates a tradeoff between sum
of the users’ data rates and accomplishing fairness between
users’ data rates.
Figs. 2, 3, are shown for 𝐷 = 0.1, which is chosen
heuristically to ensure a reasonable trade off between sum
of the users’ data rates and accomplishing fairness between
users’ data rates. In Fig. 2, the number of users varies from
4-16 in increment of 2, while in Fig. 3, 𝐾 = 16.
In Fig. 2, it can be seen the reasonable price being paid in
order to guarantee fairness by using the proposed algorithm.
As the number of users increases, the difference in sum
data rates increases because additional multiuser diversity is

available to [4] [5] that only target sum data rate maximization.
On the other hand, more users put more constraints to the
proposed algorithm, because new users need to share the
same resources. In addition, sum data rate of the proposed
algorithm is significantly enhanced over both RR-WF and
RR-EQ algorithm. MRC algorithm is the lower bound of the
proposed algorithm as in MRC each subcarrier is allocated
to only one user. Sum data rate of [7] is degraded compared
with [4] [5] and enhanced over the other algorithms, because
it imposes a kind of fairness between users’ data rates.
In Fig. 3, fairness index 𝐹𝑝 is a modified version of the one
introduced in [1], and is defined as
∑𝐾
𝑘 2
( 𝑘=1 𝑅
𝛾𝑘 )
,
𝐹𝑝 = ∑𝐾 𝑅
𝐾 𝑘=1 ( 𝛾𝑘𝑘 )2
where 𝐹𝑝 is a real number in the interval (0, 1] with the
maximum value of 1 for the case that the achieved data rate
proportions among the users are the same as the predetermined
set {𝛾𝑘 }𝐾
𝑘=1 . Employing [4] [5], no guarantees are provided
for the fairness between user data rates and as the number of
users increases, fairness index degrades. RR-WF, RR-EQ, and
[7] experience almost the same 𝐹𝑝 regardless of the number of
users, because these algorithms achieve approximately equal
data rates among users. The proposed algorithm and MRC
distribute the sum data rate very well among users, very close
to the defined ideal data rate constraints which is the main
point of this paper. However, MRC does not exploit the 𝑇 = 4
degrees of freedom that are available in each subcarrier.

V. C ONCLUSION
A fairness-aware user selection and resource allocation
algorithm, which is based both on ZF beamforming and on
spatial correlation, for the MISO downlink over frequencyselective channels was introduced. The main goal was to
achieve proportional fairness among users’ data rates despite
the loss with respect to the unconstrained case where the only
target is the maximization of the sum data rate. Simulation
results provide proofs about these statements.
