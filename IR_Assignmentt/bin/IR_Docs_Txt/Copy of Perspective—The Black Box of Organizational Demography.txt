PERSPECTIVE

With this first issue, OrganizationScience inaugurates a new editorial format called
"Perspective." It is intended as an occasional forum for featuring theoretical or
critical essays that challenge accepted thinking or established empirical approaches in
organization studies.
Perspective articles will be selected from among those already accepted for
publication in Organization Science. The nomination will be made by the Senior
Editor who accepted the paper for publication in Organization Science. The
determination for publishing in Perspective will be made on the basis of demonstrated
significant potential to redirect contemporary thought and methods relating to
important topics and issues in the field. Perspective articles will appear in the earliest
possible issue.
The paper, "The Black Box of Organizational Demography," by Barbara Lawrence,
undertakes the challenging task of questioning and clarifying the logical and
methodological underpinning of organizational demography which so far has not
been subject to sustained critical reflections.
This thoughtful and balanced paper, which questions assumptions and identifies
major problems affecting this well-established stream of research, offers new directions
that could enrich and redirect organizational demography research.

Abstract
Since its definition in the early 1980s, organizational demography has become an influential research area. Scholars map
the relationship between demographic variables and organizational outcomes, examining such questions as whether increasing work group diversity leads to greater turnover and
whether decreasing tenure similarity within a top management team leads to more numerous strategic reorientations.

Asking such questions requires only a demographic predictor
and an outcome, but answering them often requires additional theoretical constructs. For example, the relationship
between work group diversity and turnover might be explained by communication and conflict. As work group diversity increases, communication within the group may become
more difficult, resulting in greater conflict and thus increasing turnover.

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

Despite the important,sometimes critical, role of such
additionaltheoreticalconcepts,researchersoften leave them
loosely specified and unmeasured,creating a "black box"
filled with vague, untested theories. This article presents a
critical analysis of this approach. The results show that
simpledemographicexplanationsmaygeneratemultiple,mutually exclusive, often implicit theories involvingnumerous
additionalconcepts. An evaluationof these more complex
theories against previous research shows that they receive
only weak support.Hence, the blackbox approachto organizational demographypresents serious theoreticalproblems.
Examples are provided to illuminatethese problems.Four
directions are suggested for research in organizationaldemography:deepeningcurrentvarianceexplanations,creating
dynamicmodels, exploringfactorsthat producedemographic
distributions,and movingbeyondthe variancemodel.
(Organizational Demography; Organizational Theory;
Levels of Analysis)

In 1981 and 1983, Pfeffer proposed organizational demography as a new field of study and outlined an
ambitious research agenda that has been followed with
enthusiasm. Organizational demography is generally
defined as the study of the composition of a social
entity in terms of its members' attributes (Pfeffer 1983,
p. 303). The compositional component of this definition distinguishes organizational demography from
most previous demographic approaches. Organizational demography focuses on attributes as aggregatelevel rather than individual-level variables, and suggests that they influence behavior independently of
individual-level attributes. Thus, organizational demography encompasses a theoretically distinct class of variables.
One of Pfeffer's central arguments for using demographic variables was methodological. He suggested
that because critical concepts such as attitudes, cognitions, and values cannot be measured directly, significant problems plague organizational research:
measurement error, differences in conceptual definitions, violations of theoretical parsimony, and low levels of explained variation. He then argued that demographic variables may prove superior to these better
known concepts because they are easily measured and
produce more parsimonious explanations.
This is a provocative argument. In its strong form, it
proposes abolishing an entire class of variables that has
been central to organizational research. Yet researchers in organizational demography have accepted
it without debate or discussion. Typically they have
hypothesized various subjective concepts that explain

2

the significant association between demographic predictors and outcomes. Although such concepts are not
directly observable, they can be operationalized, and
the resulting measures can be tested for reliability and
validity. However, by invoking Pfeffer's justification,
researchers usually leave the concepts unmeasured and
the hypotheses untested. As a result, subjective concepts and their relationships within research models
have become the "black box" of organizational demography.
Undoubtedly organizational demography is extremely useful and broadens organizational research by
adding an important class of variables. However,
Pfeffer's instrumental approach, emphasizing prediction over explanation, has serious limitations. By assuming that all subjective concepts have equal theoretical value or by dismissing them altogether, this
approach eliminates numerous explanations for the
relationship between demographic predictors and outcomes. Important questions such as whether subjective
variables operate as true intervening processes or
whether demographic predictors act as indicators for
these variables become irrelevant for study.
This article presents a critical analysis of this approach to organizational demography. The problematic
''congruence assumption" is elaborated in the next
section. A clear understanding of the congruence assumption provides an important starting point and
perspective for understanding organizational demography. Then a more detailed introduction to organizational demography, including its definition and boundaries, is furnished. This is followed by an evaluation of
the congruence assumption based on previous research
and scrutiny of alternate explanations. The conclusion
is that demographic studies involving hypothesized but
untested subjective concepts run a high risk of spurious
explanation. The final section builds on the implications of this evaluation by proposing that scholars
develop organizational demography by deepening current variance explanations, creating dynamic models,
exploring factors that produce demographic distributions, and moving beyond variance models for alternate
interpretations of demographic phenomena.

The Problem with the Congruence
Assumption
The issue addressed in this article is how organizational demographers interpret the relationship between demographic variables and outcomes. Their interpretations typically include subjective concepts, yet

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

most organizational demography studies neither
measure the subjective concepts nor test the related
inferences. The problem is not so much with this
procedure itself, as research frequently includes inferences based on unmeasured variables or untested hypotheses, but with the presumption that testing the
inferences is somehow unnecessary.
Organizational demographers justify this presumption, either explicitly or implicitly, by making a congruence assumption based on Pfeffer's original discussion.
Pfeffer argued that demographic variables may prove
superior to widely used subjective concepts because
(1) demographic variables are directly observable, and
hence more reliable and valid measures, and (2) by
supplanting subjective variables, demographic variables
produce more parsimonious models of human behavior
(Pfeffer 1983, p. 302). In this argument, parsimony
results from replacing several subjective concepts with
a smaller number of demographic ones. However, the
rationale for why subjective concepts can be replaced
by demographic ones is not clearly delineated.
As shown in the following statements, scholars typically justify such replacement by assuming congruence
between demographic predictors and subjective concepts. In other words, demographic variables not only
are more easily and accurately measured than subjective concepts, but also capture the variation in these
concepts, which therefore can be eliminated from study.
It is possible for demography to do a better job at explaining
variation in the dependent variables than measures of the
presumed intervening constructs, for the reason that many of
the subjective concepts are mental processes (attitudes toward
various elements of compensation, for example) that are more
difficult to access and reliably measure (Pfeffer 1983, p. 351).
Although it is important to examine the effects of demography on actual communication behavior it is also useful to see
whether or not direct indicators of demographic composition
can be used as explanatory variables, eliminating the need to
gather communication information, sociometric choice data
that may be prone to errors in recall (Wagner et al. 1984,
p. 80).
True, demographic indicators may contain more noise than
purer psychological measures. For example, a person's educational background may serve as a muddied indicator of socioeconomic background, motivation, cognitive style, risk
propensity, and other underlying traits. But, given this weakness, if demographic data yield significant findings, then the
upper echelons theory will have been put to a relatively
stringent test (Hambrick and Mason 1984, p. 196).

The advantage of the congruence assumption is that
scholars can eliminate subjective concepts without
compromising a model's predictive or explanatory accu-

racy. The disadvantage is that it obscures clear thinking. At first glance, the quoted statements appear
relatively straightforward. Each suggests that demographic variables capture the variation in subjective
concepts, which then have reduced importance in a
given study. However, these statements are open to
several mutually exclusive interpretations of the relationship between demographic variables and subjective
concepts. Three possible interpretations, shown graphically in Figure 1, can be used to reexamine the statements.
The first interpretation treats demographic variables
as predictors in an instrumental theory. Instrumental
theories differ fundamentally from typical organizational theories because they concentrate on accurate
prediction rather than explanation. Explanation is seen
as essentially antithetical to prediction. Hence, such
theories are more or less effective rather than more or
less true. In this approach, demographic variables prove
good predictors when they provide effective, consistent
predictions for some outcome, regardless of the context in which the relationship is studied (Boyd 1991;
Cartwright 1991; Suppe 1974, p. 29). Once a predictive
relationship is demonstrated, explanatory relationships

3

BARBARA S. LAVVRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

between demographic, subjective, and outcome variables are unnecessary and irrelevant. Many organizational scholars would not consider instrumental theories as "theory" at all because, by definition, they do
not answer the question "why?" (Sutton and Staw
1995).
More traditionally, in the second and third interpretations, demographic variables are predictors in an
explanatory theory. The second interpretation treats
demographic variables as indicators of subjective concepts that produce some outcome. In this approach,
demographic variables prove good predictors when they
show reliability and validity as measures of the subjective concept. When reliability and validity are high,
demographic variables provide reasonable substitutes
for subjective concepts. These substitutes can be used
to test hypothesized relationships between subjective
concepts and outcomes with some accuracy.
The third interpretation treats subjective concepts as
true interveningprocesses, also called mediators (James
and Brett 1984, Rosenberg 1968), in their relationship
to both demographic predictors and outcomes. In this
approach, demographic variables prove good predictors when they predict some outcome because both
predictor and outcome are related to the intervening
process. The demographic predictor is antecedent to
the subjective concept, which is itself antecedent to the
outcome. When the intervening process is included in
the relationship, the predictor and outcome are no
longer related. In other words, the intervening process
"accounts for" the original relationship between the
demographic predictor and the outcome.
When we consider these alternate interpretations,
the quoted statements become more difficult to understand. Hambrick and Mason's (1984) is the simplest of
the three, primarily suggesting an indicator interpretation. Hambrick and Mason state that "a person's educational background may serve as a muddied indicator"
of a variety of underlying traits. Thus, they perceive
single demographic predictors as capturing variation,
albeit with some error, in a wide variety of subjective,
individual characteristics.
The statement by Wagner and his coauthors is slightly
more complex. The first phrase implies an intervening
process approach: "... . it is important to examine the
effects of demography on actual communication behavior.' This suggests that demographic variables are antecedent to actual communication behavior, and thus
implies that communication behavior acts as an intervening process. However, the next phrase suggests an
instrumental approach: "... . it is also useful to see
whether or not direct indicators of demographic com-

4

position can be used as explanatory variables, eliminating the need to gather communication information... ." In other words, if demographic variables
work as direct predictors of outcomes, perhaps one can
eliminate the need for gathering subjective data.
Pfeffer's statement also produces multiple interpretations. It identifies "mental processes" as "intervening
constructs," thus suggesting an intervening process
approach. Demographic variables predict mental processes that act as intervening processes between demographic variables and outcomes. However, the statement also suggests an indicator approach. Pfeffer says
that demographic variables may "do a better job at
explaining variation in the dependent variables" than
subjective constructs, because subjective constructs "are
more difficult to access and reliably measure." The
implication is that demographic variables may provide
better indicators of subjective concepts than attempts
to measure such concepts directly, and thus perform
better at explaining variation in outcomes. Finally, the
statement can be interpreted as implying an instrumental approach. It says that intervening constructs are
only "presumed," suggesting that although other scholars feel such constructs are important, in fact, such
constructs may be altogether unnecessary.
These justifications of the congruence assumption
gloss over several distinct understandings of the relationship between demographic variables and outcomes.
Yet scholars employ the assumption uncritically, creating studies that propose a variance-capturing relationship between demographic predictors and subjective
concepts, without specifying precisely why the relationship occurs. An example of a typical study follows.
A group of early organizational demography studies
examined the relationship between organizational
tenure and turnover (McCain et al. 1983, Pfeffer 1983,
Wagner et al. 1984). McCain and his colleagues (1983,
p. 628) suggest that the greater the gaps in years
between tenure cohorts (demographic predictor 1) and
the larger the size of the tenure cohorts (demographic
predictor 2), the more difficulty members of different
cohorts experience in communicating with one another
(subjective concept 1), the more likely members of
different cohorts are to have power struggles and conflict with one another (subjective concept 2), and the
more serious the power struggles and conflict are likely
to be when they occur (subjective concept 3). This set
of difficulties was then hypothesized to produce
turnover (outcome). People who dislike conflict and
communication problems (subjective concept 4) would
be likely to leave and people who are losers in power
struggles (subjective concept 5) may either choose or

be asked to leave. McCain et al. found that 39% of the
variation in turnover across faculty groups and 12% to
21% of the variation in turnover within various faculty
subgroups was explained by two demographic variables: cohort size and cohort gaps. Thus, their results
supported the proposed demographic explanation.
The congruence assumption used in this example is
appealing. Obtaining organizational tenure information from organizations is clearly easier and less burdened by reliability and validity issues than obtaining
communication and conflict perceptions from representative organizational members. However, the assumption creates a black box whose contents remain
unknown and may have little to do with the hypothesized explanation. Is the relationship between organizational tenure and turnover really explained by communication difficulties, conflict, and power struggles?
Do the five subjective concepts operate in the sequential process proposed in the explanation? Do they
represent true intervening processes or is organizational tenure an indicator for one or more of the
concepts? Is one or more of the concepts more important in explaining the outcome of the study, and if so is
the relationship conditional on other individual or situational factors? Are tenure cohort gaps and size appropriate measures for the five subjective concepts? Assuming away these alternate explanations and potential
measurement issues seriously limits the study's contribution.
Before we consider the congruence assumption in
more detail, it will be helpful to examine the characteristics that define organizational demography and develop some general language for it. These characteristics are important for several reasons. First, they define
what is and what is not organizational demography.
Many of the problems with the congruence assumption
result from definitional confusion, so we need a common understanding of the defining characteristics of
organizational demography. Second, the characteristics
provide boundaries for studies of the congruence assumption in general, and for the evaluation presented
here in particular. Not all organizational demography
studies require the congruence assumption, and the
differences between ones that do and ones that do not
need clarification.

A Short Introduction to Organizational
Demography
Like many fields in early development, organizational
demography lacks precision. In its original version
(Pfeffer 1981, 1983), organizational demography was

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, NO. 1, January-February 1997

defined by its two main contributions: compositional
variables and methodological ease. Organizational demography researchers refer to this definition, but their
elaborations venture beyond these features, leading
some people to wonder whether there is anything that
is not organizational demography. The following discussion outlines the dimensions of the problem and
provides general boundaries for the ensuing evaluation
of the congruence assumption.
As shown in Table 1, five characteristics define the
boundaries of organizational demography: the demographic unit selected for study, the attributes of the
demographic unit, the domain within which the attributes are studied, the measures of the attributes, and
the mechanism by which the attributes predict outcomes. Each can be construed either broadly or narrowly. A broad construal does not distinguish organizational demography from most other studies of
organizational behavior. A narrow construal excludes
works currently considered within the organizational
demography domain.
Demographic Unit
The demographic unit is the level of analysis to which
theoretical generalizations will be made. Organizational demography currently accommodates a relatively
broad definition of this characteristic, including individuals within groups (e.g., Ferris et al. 1991), dyads
(e.g., Tsui and O'Reilly 1989), groups (e.g., Ancona and
Caldwell 1992), and organizations (e.g., Shenhav and
Haberfeld 1992). Studies that use individuals as the
demographic unit (e.g., Waldman and Avolio 1986),
although numerous, are not generally defined as organizational demography. A broad definition would include these individual-level studies, as well as studies
employing demographic units larger than organizations
such as niches, regional areas, or industries.
Attributes
Attributes are defined at the level of analysis at which
data are collected rather than at the level of analysis of
the demographic unit. Organizational demographers
currently study individual attributes almost exclusively.
Individual attributes generally fit into three categories:
attributes that describe immutable characteristics such
as age, gender, and ethnicity; attributes that describe
individuals' relationships with organizations, such as
organizational tenure or functional area; and attributes
that identify individuals' positions within society, such
as marital status. These three categories of attributes
are readily detectable by other people and generally
unchanging. They exclude personal attributes, such as

Characteristics Defining the Boundaries of Organizational Demography
Definition

Examples

Demographic Unit

The entity to which theoretical generalizations will be
made. Demographic units range from small to large,
where "small" might be an individualand "large" might
be an industry.

Individuals, dyads, groups, networks, organizations,
occupations, organizational populations, and industries
are demographic units.

Attributes

The entity characteristics used to depict the demographic unit being studied. An attribute's level of
analysis is always lower than or equal to that of the
demographic unit it represents.

Organizational tenure is an individual-level attribute.
Taskforce time for project completion is a group-level
attribute.
K-type and r-type are organizational population-level
attributes.

Domain

The social system within which the attributes of a
demographic unit are studied. A domain's level of
analysis is always higher than or equal to that of the
demographic unit being studied.

Dyads, groups, networks, organizations, occupations,
organizational populations, and industries are domains.

Measures

The empirical definition of the attributes that depict a
demographic unit within a domain. Measures are either
simple or compositional. Simple measures are defined
at the level of analysis of the attribute. Compositional
measures are defined at a level of analysis higher than
that of the attribute.

The organizational tenure of an individual within a
group is a simple measure.
The Euclidean distance based on group members'
organizational tenure is a compositional measure.
The average organizational tenure of members within a
group is a compositional measure.

Mechanism

The process by which the attributes that depict a
demographic unit within a domain predict outcomes.
The mechanism is either indirect or direct.

A demographic

Characteristics

commitment or locus of control, that are subject to
varied interpretation by other people and generally
more mutable (see Jackson et al. 1995; Jackson et al.
1993, p. 56).
A broader definition of attributes would include
personal attributes, such as preferences or beliefs (see
Glick et al. 1993), which may produce interesting compositional effects independent of their individual influence on behavior. Moreover, it would include attributes for a broader range of demographic units, such
as a taskforce's length of time for project completion,
the extent to which a team uses external resources, and
the distribution of r- and K-types within organizational
populations. Thus, the adjective "organizational" in
organizational demography would denote a meaning
similar to the "organizational" in organizational behavior and organizational theory by including phenomena
at many levels of analysis related to organizational life.
Domain
A domain is the context within which a demographic
unit is studied. Several domains may be involved in a

6

model that requires subjective conindirect mechanism to predict outmodel that does not require subjective
a direct mechanism to explain out-

given study. For instance, a group-level demographic
unit may be studied within business unit, organizational, and industry domains. The proximal domain is
the domain closest in level of analysis to the demographic unit that holds significance for the theory being
tested. Although results generalize to the level of analysis of the demographic unit, the domains within which
demographic units are studied may also influence generalizability. For example, the impact of top management team attributes on organizational performance
is often examined in samples of organizations (see
Pettigrew 1992, for a review). The demographic unit is
the team and the domains include both the organization and the sample of organizations. The results generalize to teams within organizations, but the results'
generalizability to teams across organizations depends
on the representativeness of the sample. Organizational demography currently accommodates a relatively
narrow definition of domain. For the most part, demographic units are studied within groups, organizations,
or samples of organizations. A broader definition would
include domains appropriate for demographic units

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDeniography

defined at the organizational level of analysis or higher.
For example, the business unit attributes of organizations could be studied within niches, regional areas, or
industries.
Measures
Organizational demography currently uses two types of
measures, simple and compositional. Simple measures
(Tsui and O'Reilly 1989) describe attributes at the level
of analysis at which the data were collected. The level
of analysis of a simple measure is always the same as
that of the attribute and the demographic unit it represents. For instance, an individual's gender and age are
simple measures of individual attributes where the
individual is the demographic unit. An organization's
ROI and ROE are simple measures of organizational
attributes where the organization is the demographic
unit.
In contrast, compositional measures describe attributes at a level of analysis that differs from that at
which the data were collected. The level of analysis of
a compositional measure is always higher than that of
the attribute. Compositional measures depend empirically on the demographic unit they represent. For
instance, the similarity of each taskforce member's
organizational tenure to the organizational tenure of
other taskforce members is a compositional measure of
individual attributes in which the individual within the
group is the demographic unit. Each individual's organizational tenure similarity value depends on the organizational tenures of other members. It cannot be
measured without assessing the organizational tenure
of all group members. Thus, although organizational
tenure remains an individual-level attribute, organizational tenure similarity represents an individual-withinthe-group-level demographic unit. Other compositional
measures include averages, the coefficient of variation,
cohort sizes, and ratios.
Mechanism
The final criterion is the mechanism that explanatory
theories use to justify why a demographic unit's attributes produce specific outcomes (Lawrence 1987,
pp. 40-41). Demographic explanations that do not
require subjective concepts explain outcomes as the
direct result of the demographic variable under consideration. For instance, a direct explanation for the relationship between tenure cohort size and organizational
turnover is that tenure cohorts retire or are terminated
at relatively similar times; hence, the larger the tenure
cohort, the higher the organizational turnover. Note
that unlike the communication, conflict, and power

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

struggle explanation, this explanation requires no subjective concepts. The times at which full professors
retire and assistant professors are terminated after
negative tenure decisions are somewhat (although not
completely) independent of turmoil that occurs within
the department.
Standard personnel practices provide another example of a direct mechanism. Using assumptions about
retirement ages, hiring ages, growth, and internal promotion policies, we can predict the age distribution of
an organization in 2017 with reasonable accuracy by
knowing its age distribution in 1997. Given some
knowledge of future personnel requirements, we do
not need subjective variables to explain the relationship between the organization's current age distribution and the organization's hiring needs in 2017. The
works of White (1970), Stewman (1986), and Stewman
and Konda (1983) on vacancy chains and internal labor
markets provide examples of such direct demographic
effects.
The focus of this article, in contrast, is demographic
models in which subjective concepts explain outcomes
as the indirect result of demographic predictors through
their relationship with other variables, such as conflict,
communication, and social norms. A study by Bantel
and Jackson (1989) provides an example. These researchers suggested that demographic characteristics
such as age, tenure, and functional background characterize the cognitive abilities, attit-udes, and expertise of
the top management team. They proposed that these
subjective concepts explain the relationship between
the team's demographic characteristics and its innovativeness. In this example, individual characteristics (demographic predictors) explain innovativeness (outcome) indirectly, through their inferred relationship
with team members' abilities, attitudes, and expertise
(subjective concepts).
The mechanism characteristic tends to distinguish
macrosociological studies of organizational demography (Stewman 1988), most of which are in the direct
explanation category, from social-psychological studies,
most of which use indirect explanations.

A Few Thoughts on Boundaries
The large differences between narrow and broad definitions of these five boundary characteristics suggest
that organizational demography's current boundaries
are somewhat loose and flexible. Indeed, it seems
premature for them to be otherwise defined.' Two
ground rules are adopted to simplify the following
discussion. First, only research that invokes instrumen-

7

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

tal theories or indirect explanations for demographic
effects is examined. Explanations that assume a direct
relationship between demography and organizational
outcomes require no subjective concepts or congruence
assumption, and are outside the scope of this article.
Second, the discussion relies heavily on studies that
evolved after Pfeffer's original work, that scholars tend
to define as organizational demography, and that focus
on compositional measures.

Evaluating the Congruence Assumption
What empirical standards can be used for evaluating
the implicit theories underlying the congruence assumption, and does previous research meet these standards? What kind of measurement problems result
from the congruence assumption and how can they be
evaluated and corrected?
Standards for Assessing Implicit Theories of Congruence
Appropriate assessment of the congruence assumption
depends on the theory invoked. Different theories for
the role of subjective concepts require different acceptance criteria. The three theories introduced in the
problem presentation-instrumental, indicator, and intervening process theories-serve as examples for discussing such differences. The point in selecting these
particular theories is not to enumerate all invocations
of the congruence assumption. Numerous additional
possibilities exist including moderator, extraneous,
component, antecedent, suppressor, and distorter theories (James and Brett 1984, Rosenberg 1968). Rather,
the point is to examine the thinking that underlies
assessment.
The following discussion describes evaluation criteria for each theory and illustrates their application
using previous research. The research examples selected are similar in their independent and dependent
measures. They do not all employ the theory they are
used to illustrate, and hence should not necessarily be
held to the evaluation standards presented. Moreover,
the analysis cannot assess measurement or specification errors for either demographic predictors, subjective concepts, or outcomes. Therefore, the conclusions
from this discussion, although suggestive of certain
patterns, should be interpreted with caution.
Criteriafor InstrumentalTheory. Strictly interpreted,
instrumental theories require prediction, so the test for
instrumental theory is a significant relationship between demographic predictors and outcomes. The
characteristics of the setting, conditions, controls, sub-

8

jects, occupations, and so forth should make no difference in the results. Consequently, in contrast to almost
all organizational theory, instrumental theory explicitly
excludes explanation. Because organizational scholars
would find it difficult to accept a single study showing a
single significant association as proof of anything without an accompanying explanation, it seems reasonable
to require that instrumental theories show consistent
results in multiple studies as a standard for acceptance.
Hence, a first criterion for accepting instrumental theory is a significant relationship between the demographic predictor and the outcome in all studies, after
accounting for measurement error. In other words, the
demographic predictor should consistently predict the
outcome. A second, more rigorous criterion is a level
of explained variation that is the same in all studies,
after accounting for measurement error. Again, what
matters is the consistency rather than the absolute size
of the effect.
Consider six studies (Jackson et al. 1991, McCain
et al. 1983, O'Reilly et al. 1989, Wagner et al. 1984,
Wiersema and Bantel 1993, Wiersema and Bird 1993)
that examined the relationship between tenure and
turnover in groups. Using the first criterion, we can
accept the congruence assumption if the relationship
between tenure and turnover is significant for all
groups. On the basis of subgroup results, which show
more significant relationships than group results and
thus have greater probability of meeting the first criterion, the six studies show a significant relationship in
seven of twelve groups. A binomial test shows that
when twelve significant relationships are expected, the
probability of getting only seven significant relationships due to measurement error is extremely low
(p < 0.001). Thus, although by some standards these
results seem strong, they do not meet the first criterion
for an instrumental interpretation of the congruence
assumption.
A more careful match of predictors produces similar
results. The studies can be divided into two sets that
use identical demographic predictQrs.The first set consists of the Wagner et al. (1984), Jackson et al. (1991),
and Wiersema and Bird (1993) studies. They used the
same attribute, individual organizational tenure, for
the same demographic unit, top management teams,
measured by the same compositional measure, the
coefficient of variation. The three studies show a significant relationship in only one of four groups. A binomial test indicates that when four significant relationships are expected, the probability of getting only one
significant relationship due to measurement error is
extremely low (p < 0.01).

The second set consists of the O'Reilly et al. (1989),
Wiersema and Bantel (1993), and Wiersema and Bird
(1993) studies. These are very similar to the Wagner
et al. (1984) and Jackson et al. (1991) studies except
the attribute used was individual group tenure rather
than individual organizational tenure. The three studies show a significant relationship in one of four groups.
A binomial test indicates that when four significant
relationships are expected, the probability of getting
one significant relationship due to measurement error
is extremely low (p < 0.001). Hence, even when the
studies are matched as closely as possible, the results
do not meet the criterion for an instrumental interpretation of the congruence assumption.
The second criterion for accepting the congruence
assumption is that the relationship between tenure and
turnover must show consistent levels of explained variation from one study to the next. We have already
observed that only seven of the original twelve groups
have the required significant relationship. However,
assume that these seven groups represent all studies of
the phenomenon, thus meeting the first criterion for
instrumental theory. By the stricter criterion, the five
groups for which sufficient data are given (all within
the McCain et al. study), should exhibit similar levels
of explained variation. The results show that the level
of explained variation, independent of control variables, ranges from 12% to 21% with an average of
17.4%. One could argue that a range of 9 percentage
points in five groups represents good consistency, or
that it represents too much spread to justify consistency. Therefore, if the first criterion had been met,
evaluation by the second criterion would have been
inconclusive. Combining the results, we see that an
instrumental theory should be rejected, which suggests
that explanatory theory (e.g., indicator, intervening
process, or some other type of explanation) is required.
Criteriafor Indicator Explanations. Indicator explanations require high reliability and validity. A single- or
multiple-item demographic variable indicating a subjective concept should have a lower limit of 0.7 as a
reliability standard for exploratory research (Nunnally
1978, p. 245), and, for this lower limit, an upper boundary of 0.84 for validity.
Four studies (Ancona and Caldwell 1992, Hoffman
1985, South et al. 1982, Zenger and Lawrence 1989)
provide data that allow assessment of demographic
variables as indicators of communication frequency, a
subjective concept often cited by organizational demographers. The studies report 15 relationships between five demographic attributes and communication

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

frequency. The attributes are defined at the individual
level of analysis within group and organizational demographic units using compositional measures: sex composition (six relationships), race-ratio (three relationships), tenure similarity (three relationships), age
similarity (two relationships), and functional diversity
(one relationship). For these 15 relationships, the reliability values computed by using r2 average 0.06 and
range from 0.002 to 0.19. On the basis of these values,
the upper boundary of validity averages 0.19 with a
range of 0.04 to 0.43. Hence, the studies provide little
support for using single-item demographic variables as
indicators of communication frequency.
A fifth study (Lincoln and Miller 1979), frequently
cited as providing evidence for the relationship between demographic variables and communication, also
generates little support for an indicator interpretation.
This study differs somewhat from the other four in that
it examined simple rather than compositional demographic variables. Moreover, a different communication measure was used. The impact of five individual
attributes (authority, education, sex, race, and branch)
on communication was studied in five organizations.
The communication measure was path distance, the
minimum number of communication links connecting
each pair of individuals. The results, reported for 42
relationships between attributes and communication
within work and friendship networks, were similar to
those in the other four studies. Using q2 as a counterpart to r2 shows the average reliability of single-item
demographic variables as indicators of communication
to be 0.04, ranging from 0.001 to 0.31. The average
validity for these variables is 0.17, ranging from 0.03 to
0.56.
The same five studies provide data for assessing
several multiple-item demographic indicators of communication. As expected, multiple-item measures perform better than single-item measures. For three twoitem measures, the average reliability is 0.59, ranging
from 0.50 to 0.67, and the average validity is 0.78,
ranging from 0.74 to 0.82: individual organizational
tenure and functional diversity as attributes of group
demographic units (Ancona and Caldwell 1992), individual age and group tenure as attributes of a group
demographic unit (Zenger and Lawrence 1989), and
individual age and organizational tenure as attributes
of an organizational demographic unit (Zenger and
Lawrence 1989). In the Lincoln and Miller (1979) study,
the average reliability for 10 five- and six-item
measures is 0.15, ranging from 0.02 to 0.36, and the
corresponding validity for these measures averages 0.36,
ranging from 0.13 to 0.58. None of these results meet

9

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

the a = 0.7 reliability criterion, but they suggest that
with some additional work, multiple-item demographic
measures may provide reasonable indicators for communication. Overall, however, the single- and
multiple-item results from the five studies suggest that
previous research does not support demographic variables as indicators of communication.
Criteriafor Intervening Process Explanations. Intervening process explanations require empirical validation of specific interdependencies between demographic, subjective, and outcome variables (Rosenberg
1968). Because the final test of an intervening process
explanation requires measuring the subjective concept,
it is not possible to provide evaluation criteria for such
explanations under the congruence assumption. However, intervening process explanations do not rule out
alternate interpretations or situations that might explain a null result as do instrumental theories, nor do
they require high proportions of explained variation as
do indicator explanations. Hence, once the subjective
concept has been measured, acceptance conditions for
these explanations are considerably more forgiving than
those for either instrumental theories or indicator explanations.
A description of what defines an intervening process
and an empirical example help highlight these issues.
By definition, an intervening variable accounts for the
original relationship between an independent variable
and a dependent variable. When an intervening variable is included in the analysis, the original association
between the independent and dependent variables disappears. Assume, for example, that regression analysis
shows a significant relationship between organizational
tenure and turnover. If conflict is the intervening process through which that relationship occurs, when conflict is included in a second regression, organizational
tenure is no longer a significant predictor and it directly explains no variation in turnover.
Heilman (1980) provided an example of an intervening process explanation in her study of how varying the
sex composition of an applicant pool influences personnel evaluations of female applicants. In her study of
100 MBA students, subjects were asked to evaluate
eight applicants for a managerial position in a large
insurance company. The sex composition of the eight
applicants was varied from 12.5% women to 100%
women. The original results consistently showed that
sex composition was associated significantly with personnel evaluations. Women in applicant pools in which
the proportion of women exceeded 25% received more
positive evaluations than women in applicant pools

10

with 25% or fewer women. Heilman hypothesized that
this sex composition effect resulted from an intervening process: the job's gender characterization. In other
words, she hypothesized that subjects used the sex
composition of the applicant pool to assign the job a
gender characterization. The higher the proportion
women, the more likely subjects would be to classify
the job as having "female" stereotypical characteristics.
Such gender characterizations would then produce
evaluation differences. Women applying for jobs classified as female would be evaluated more positively than
women applying for jobs classified as male.
To test this intervening process explanation, Heilman first tested and found a significant relationship
between sex composition and gender characterizations
of the job. She then retested the original relationship
between sex composition and personnel evaluations
with subjects' gender characterizations of the job as the
covariate. In this final test, no significant effects involving sex composition were observed. Thus, Heilman
showed that the original relationship in which sex
composition predicted personnel evaluations occurred
because sex composition influenced the way in which
subjects stereotyped jobs by gender characteristics.
Cleveland et al. (1988) found a similar intervening
process effect for applicant pools that vary by age. The
original age composition effects on personnel ratings
disappeared when the age-type of the job was used as a
covariate.
Thus, in these studies intervening process explanations were evaluated by testing the impact of the subjective concept on the original relationship between the
demographic predictor and the outcome. Research using congruence assumptions cannot provide such tests.
Criteriafor Other Explanations. Other explanations
for the congruence assumption include antecedent and
moderator explanations. Although no attempt is made
here to explicate all possibilities, an upper limit for
accepting them can be established. At a most basic
level within explanatory theories, the congruence assumption suggests that demographic variables and subjective concepts are related. Hence, the number of
significant relationships between these variables provides an upper limit for those cases in which the
congruence assumption is plausible. A review of such
relationships provides some support for this conclusion. The 19 articles2 shown in Table 2 report 348
predictions about relationships between demographic
variables and subjective concepts.
Of the relationships that can be evaluated by significance tests, 42% (127 of 305 predictions) are

significant. Single demographic variables explain 30%
of the variation in a subjective concept in two cases:
the relationship between tenure similarity and group
integration (O'Reilly et al. 1989), and the relationship
between age composition and age stereotypes of jobs
(Cleveland and Hollman 1990). Multiple demographic
variables explain more than 30% of the variation in a
subjective concept in three cases: the explained variation in work-related communication chains exceeds
30% in two organizations when the predictions of five

and Miller 1979); and the explained variation in workrelated communication frequency outside project

groups exceeds 30% when the predictions of two simple demographic predictors are summed (Zenger and
Lawrence 1989). This simple, broad-brush evaluation
shows that, for these studies, all forms of the congruence assumption are rejected in 58% of the predictions.
This high rejection rate warrants attention as it
probably represents a best-case estimate. An effort was
made to err on the side of producing the highest
number of significant relationships between demographic predictors and subjective concepts. Further,
most of the studies actively sought these relationships
and probably would not have been published without

11

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

them. Therefore, although this finding does not cast
doubt on the importance of demographic predictors, it
does raise serious questions about the blanket inclusion of unmeasured subjective concepts in demographic theories.
Standards for Assessing Measurement
Ambiguities in Congruence
Once an implicit theory is established, the next step is
assessing whether a model's constructs are measured
appropriately. This evaluation does not differ from
measurement evaluations in other studies. However,
the congruence assumption seems to distract scholars
from including subjective concepts in the evaluation
process. As a result, ambiguities in levels of analysis
are common in organizational demography research.
Two central measurement criteria are that (1) demographic measures must plausibly capture proposed theoretical constructs and (2) theoretical and empirical
levels of analysis for the proposed constructs must
match. The current organizational demography literature does a relatively good job with the first criterion.
Most demographic measures provide plausible metrics
for the demographic concept and for at least one of the
proposed subjective concepts. The current literature
has more difficulty with the second criterion. The theoretical or empirical levels of analysis for the proposed
concepts are not always clearly stated, and the result is
conceptual ambiguity.

There are no "tests" for levels-of-analysis ambiguities, but examples can help us explore the subtleties of
the issue.3 First, levels-of-analysis matches are constructed to show how slight differences in demographic
models and their interpretations produce significant
and sometimes contradictory differences in hypotheses.
Then an extended example of levels-of-analysis ambiguity from the literature is reviewed.
Three Examples of Levels-of-Analysis Matches. Let
us consider three theoretically similar hypotheses, each
involving the relationship between a team's organizational tenure (demographic predictor) and its communication frequency (outcome). At the outset, the
congruence assumption for this relationship seems relatively straightforward: as organizational tenure increases, communication frequency either increases or
decreases. However, although this statement captures
the similarity of the three hypotheses, it also masks
their differences. Each hypothesis involves subtle differences in explanation. As shown in Table 3, the
correctly specified hypotheses, including constructs with
matching demographic units, domains, and measures,
bear similarities to the statement but also differ from it
and sometimes contradict one another.

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

The explanation underlying this hypothesis might be
that an individual's organizational tenure provides a
surrogate for his or her characteristics or experiences.
Individuals with short tenure are assumed to know
fewer people than individuals with long tenure. Hence,
the longer people have worked in an organization, the
more people they know, and the more likely they are to
communicate frequently. Because getting to know all
members of large groups is difficult, people who already know more people in the organization are likely
to know more people within a large group in the
organization. As a result, as an individual's organizational tenure increases (demographic predictor), he or
she knows more people (subjective concept) and therefore, given a large group, is likely to communicate
more frequently with people within the group (outcome).
A typical problem in designing an appropriate study
might be confusion of the domain with the demographic unit. Specifying the group's size encourages the
use of groups as the demographic unit, so scholars
might use a group-level measure such as average organizational tenure as the demographic predictor. However, the theory underlying the relationship between
the demographic predictor and the subjective concept
suggests an individual-level explanation. Therefore a
group-level measure is inappropriate. In this case, the
group is the domain rather than the demographic unit.
HYPOTHESIS 2. As a group's average organizational
tenure increases, communication frequency within the
group decreases.

The explanation for this hypothesis, in which the
negative association between organizational tenure and
communication frequency directly contradicts the positive association predicted in the first example, might be
that groups with homogeneous organizational tenure
develop a common bond among members that facilitates communication. During the initial years of organizational tenure, the group requires frequent communication to complete tasks. However, over time, the
group develops work routines that decrease the need
for frequent communication. Hence, as a group's organizational tenure increases (demographic predictor), it
develops work routines (subjective concept), and thus
its communication frequency decreases (outcome).
A typical problem in designing an appropriate study
might be confusion of individual-level effects with
group-level effects. In this example, the explanation
assumes that groups are relatively homogeneous in
organizational tenure. Yet without prior knowledge,

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

theoretical rationale, or testing for within-group similarity and between-group differences, one cannot expect a group of individuals with a random set of
organizational tenures to have experienced the suggested bonding. The individuals within such groups are
independent on the criterion of interest. The possible
within-group variance is too high to predict whether
bonding will occur.
HYPOTHESIS 3. As the similarity of an individual's
organizational tenure to that of others in a group increases, the individual's communication frequency with
others in the group increases.

The explanation for this hypothesis might be that the
similarity of an individual's organizational tenure to
that of others in a group is related positively to the
number of his or her shared experiences and the level
of his or her comfort with those others. Perhaps the
more similar people are to others in a group, the more
experiences they share, the more comfortable they feel
with one another, and thus the more frequently they
communicate.
A typical problem in designing an appropriate study
might be confusion of the domain with the demographic unit or misinterpretation of the demographic
unit. The hypothesis examines tenure similarity within
groups, which suggests that the demographic unit is the
group. As a result, scholars might tend to use a grouplevel measure such as average organizational tenure.
However, the theory underlying the relationship between the demographic predictor and the subjective
concept suggests an individual-within-the-group-level
explanation. The group is the domain rather than the
demographic unit. Also, because this congruence assumption appears similar to that in the first
example-both suggest a positive association between
organizational tenure and communication frequencyscholars might tend to generalize results of both studies to the same level of analysis. Such generalizations
would be inappropriate because the demographic unit
in the first example is the individual, whereas the
demographic unit in this third example is the individual-within-a-group.
An Example of Levels-of-AnalysisAmbiguity. Finkelstein and Hambrick's (1990) research on top management teams is useful for extended examination because
it provides an important contribution to its literature.
It is one of the few organizational demography studies
that both hypothesizes the existence of and evaluates
the moderating effect of a subjective concept

13

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of QiganizationalDemography

(managerial discretion). However, it also exhibits levels-of-analysis ambiguities. The intent here is not to
criticize the study, but to show how the congruence
assumption hides ambiguity in levels of analysis, even
in high quality research.
The authors use the "upper echelons argument" to
explain the general impact of a firm's leaders on organizational outcomes. They hypothesize that as a top
management team's firm tenure increases, the firm's
strategies become more stable and more similar to the
industry average, and its firm's performance becomes
more similar to the industry average (Finkelstein and
Hambrick 1990, p. 497). The demographic unit in this
theory is the team, the attribute is an executive's firm
tenure, and the measure is the average firm tenure of
executives within top management teams.
The authors are quite clear that their concern is
group-level effects on organizational outcomes. However, as in the preceding "organizational tenure influences communication frequency" example, their simple
hypothesis masks demographic and subjective concepts
at several levels of analysis. Whether the outcomes are
really group effects is unclear. They may also be individual or even individual-within-the-group effects. The
following extended quotations provide a representative
feel for these levels-of-analysis differences. The point
is not that the explanations are incorrect, but that they
introduce concepts at different levels of analysis that
are not then included in the study.
Explanations at the group level:
We draw -from available literature to argue that a top team's
tenure in the organization affects (and serves as an approximation for) the team's commitment to the status quo, its
informational diversity, and its attitudes toward risk. In turn,
team tenure is expected to affect organizational outcomes.
(p. 486)
The top team as a whole tends to develop similar repertoires
because long-term acculturation of team members creates a
common perspective or organizational paradigm... . (p. 487)

Explanations at the individual level:
As individuals spend time in an organization, and particularly
as they succeed and climb the organization's hierarchy, they
become convinced of the wisdom of the organization's ways
(Wanous 1980). They become committed to their own prior
actions, especially when those actions were taken publicly and
were explicit, as typically characterizes strategic choices....
(p. 487)
Related to the effects tenure has on commitment to the status
quo are those it has on risk taking. At one level, commitment
derives from certain "psychological risks" of change... .
However, more tangible risks are also associated with tenure,

14

particularly for senior executives. Such individuals may have
struggled for years to achieve their top spots; their competencies have been deemed important for the firm's current configuration; as long-term employees, they have more firmspecific than general human capital; and they typically are
well established in their communities, social circles, and family life-cycles .... Essentially, they have far more to lose than
to gain by taking "unnecessary risks".... (p. 487)

One could argue that using individual-level arguments to describe the team's behavior makes little
difference to the analysis because teams with individuals having higher levels of specified characteristics will
behave differently than teams with individuals having
lower levels of those characteristics. However, if the
relationship between firm tenure and organizational
performance is really an individual-level effect, it is not
necessary to study the team at all. One could literally
examine the firm tenures of a large sample of executives, independent of their team or firm, and expect
either the same or better results. If the relationship
between firm tenure and organizational performance is
really an individual-level effect, studying it at the group
level may attenuate the relationship.
A second problem is that, in addition to individualand group-level effects, individual-within-the-grouplevel processes may be operating. The second statement quoted above could be interpreted as either a
group-level or an individual-within-the-group-level argument. That is, it might not be just the average length
of team members' organizational tenures but the similarity among their organizational tenures that produces
a common perspective. These two distinct explanations
require different compositional measures.
Table 4, showing a simple example involving two
groups, clarifies the potentially distinctive information.
In both groups, the average organizational tenure is
three years. However, Aztec has lower average similarity among its executives' organizational tenures than
Baxso. This means that although average organizational tenure is the same in both firms, top management team members at Aztec are more similar to one
another in their organizational tenure than top management team members at Baxso. If average organizational tenure is used to predict the common perspective of the two teams, identical commonality in
perspectives is predicted. Yet, an organizational tenure
similarity measure suggests that Aztec's team will have
a more widely shared organizational paradigm than
Baxso's team. (See Zenger and Lawrence (1989, p. 371)
for another discussion of this issue. See Klein et al.
(1994) for a detailed discussion of such levels-ofanalysis issues.)

BARBARAS. LAVVRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

The result of this levels-of-analysis ambiguity is that
Finkelstein and Hambrick's demographic predictor, the
top management team's average firm tenure, captures
the group-level but not the individual-level or the individual-within-the-group-level relationships suggested by
the authors' explanations for their congruence assumption. To include these components, the study would
require two additional demographic predictors: individual firm tenure and a similarity measure of individual
firm tenure. More importantly, the missing predictors
raise several questions. Did Finkelstein and Hambrick
miss additional explained variations in organizational
outcomes because they did not include all three demographic predictors? Are the phenomena they uncover
really team-level phenomena or are they better explained by individual behaviors or similarity effects?
Do all three demographic predictors help explain the
relationship between these executives and their firms?
The issue here is not the contribution of the study, but
how the congruence assumption tends to obscure complex and intriguing relationships and associations that
could have been specified, studied, or noted as limitations for further study.

Conclusions about the Congruence
Assumption
The results from the preceding examination of evaluation criteria for and subsequent assessment of the
congruence assumption are mixed. Many demographic
variables are related to subjective concepts, but many
are not. Demographic predictors often capture variation in some of the hypothesized subjective concepts.
However, the congruence assumption seems to encourage levels-of-analysis misspecifications. This observation does not diminish the importance of demographic
predictors, but does raise questions about the appropriateness of applying the congruence assumption indiscriminately.
A first conclusion about the congruence assumption
is that some theories are more probable than others.
Scholars who use the congruence assumption frequently hold several implicit and perhaps explicit theories for their model. Yet some theories are more likely
than others. For instance, the stringent requirements
for accepting instrumental theory decrease the probability that it will work for many demographic predictors. Indicator theories, which require high reliability
and validity, also must surmount substantial empirical
hurdles for acceptance. In contrast, intervening process
theories, which do not require high proportions of
explained variation in subjective concepts, seem more

likely to fit a given dataset than their instrumental or
indicator counterparts. Similarly, given that in many
cases there is no relationship between demographic
variables and subjective concepts, it is also likely that
either no theory is appropriate or the appropriate
theory is quite complex. Inadequate data therefore
may pose a serious limitation for demographic studies
rather than an acceptable omission. Differences between theories are important and should be accorded
thoughtful treatment.
A logical extension of this conclusion is that the
demographicmodels increases
probabilityof mnisspecifying
with the number of possible theories. When the role of
subjective concepts is left unspecified, the list of theoretical possibilities expands. The greater the number of
possible theories, the greater the likelihood that any
given theory is incorrect, important variables are left
out, unimportant variables are left in, unnoted interactions are present between unmeasured variables, and
variables are measured inappropriately. At present,
researchers appear to use "convenience" explanations
that amalgamate a variety of plausible processes without assessing which processes actually belong and which
do not. The problem is that the congruence assumption
leaves the possibilities unstated, which makes it difficult to assess whether the models are well specified.

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

A third conclusion about demographic research involving the congruence assumption is that the theoretical power of the models decreases as the number of
possible subjectiveconcepts increases. Theoretical power
is a model's ability to provide an unambiguous and
parsimonious explanation for some phenomenon.
Pfeffer (1983) originally proposed demographic variables as superior to social-psychological variables aspredictors because they provide more parsimonious
explanations requiring fewer variables and multiple
interactions. However, the evaluation presented here
suggests that demographic predictors are just as limited as their social-psychological counterparts.
First, the results do not provide much support for
the more parsimonious instrumental and single-item
indicator theories. Further, although the results suggest that multiple-item indicators may operate as reliable measures of some individual behaviors or characteristics, there is no measurement parsimony advantage
to using multiple demographic variables rather than
multiple social-psychological variables. Moreover, there
is apparently no evidence that demographic variables
provide better measures of individual behaviors or
characteristics than social-psychological measures. Face
validity suggests that social-psychological variables designed to capture theoretical components of some subjective concept have a better chance of achieving high
construct validity than multiple demographic variables,
which are theoretically more distant.
Second, the results suggest that, although intervening process theories have a higher probability of working for demographic models than either instrumental
or indicator theories, intervening process theories may
be quite intricate, involving multiple subjective concepts and interactions (see Pelled 1996, for an example). Hence, for these more probable incarnations of
the congruence assumption, one loses the parsimony
sought in the first place. Moreover, research suggests
that other complex explanations are also likely, further
decreasing theoretical parsimony. For instance, several
studies show demographic variables involved in antecedent (Lawrence 1988) and moderator explanations
(Finkelstein and Hambrick 1990; Lincoln and Miller
1979; South, Corder and Markham 1982; Tsui et al.
1992; Zenger and Lawrence 1989).
In sum, the congruence assumption probably masks
elaborate relationships between demographic variables
and outcomes. This is "paper" parsimony, parsimonious only because the more complicated interactions
are assumed away. The black box seems full of questions. What is the appropriate theory or theories for
the observed outcome? What theories should be in-

16

cluded or excluded? If an explanatory theory is required, what subjective concepts should be included or
excluded? Under what conditions do those concepts
produce the predicted outcome? What dependent or
independent associations are present among the proposed subjective concepts? These inevitable questions
make demographic explanations involving the congruence assumption ambiguous. Demographic variables
commonly predict organizational outcomes, but the
underspecified role of subjective concepts within such
models greatly reduces their theoretical power.
Is the CongruenceAssumption Reasonable? A Summary
Let us now return to our original concern: Is the
congruence assumption a reasonable substitute for subjective concepts? Clearly the answer is no. The congruence assumption is unreasonable for several reasons.
The first and most important is that the data do not
provide strong support for its use. Second, it discourages careful thinking about how demographic predictors really work and under what conditions. Third,
studies that use it seem to run a high risk of spurious
explanation. The congruence assumption moves researchers farther and farther away, both empirically
and theoretically, from the actual mechanisms underlying observed relationships. Such distance is always
problematic in social science, and particularly for
quantitative studies whose measures necessarily trade
descriptive completeness for replicability and generalizability. This distance from phenomena should concern us. In the final analysis, who cares whether empirical relationships are present between demographic
variables and organizational outcomes if the reasons
for these relationships cannot be explained? Demographic variables should play no role in organizational
studies unless we understand what role they are playing.
Despite this criticism, organizational demography is
an important and useful field of study. It is not the
class of predictors that is at issue. These variables have
desirable properties. They are distinct theoretical constructs that help explain organizational outcomes. They
are easy to collect and relatively accurate (although
anyone who has carefully cleaned an organization's
demographic data knows that they are not 100% correct!). They are relatively unambiguous, thus providing
high content validity and replicability, which is an
important consideration in a field where replication is
all too infrequent. Researchers need not be concerned
that employees in one organization interpret the phrase
"chronological age" in a different way than employees
in another organization. Further, studies consistently

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOL

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

show significant relationships between demographic
variables and organizational outcomes, suggesting a
systematic association that warrants further exploration.
Finally, the problems identified in this analysis of
organizational demography are normal for any developing field of study. The difficulty is not that these
problems exist, but that using the congruence assumption tends to (1) obscure them, (2) minimize the importance of exploring solutions, and (3) allow demographic
variables either a larger or smaller role than may be
justified.

Theoretical Implications for
Organizational Demography
As suggested at the beginning of this article, the congruence assumption conceals many interesting demographic questions. The preceding critique indicates that
quite a bit of action occurs inside the black box about
which little is known. Many questions and suggestions
about that action have already been raised, and exploring all the possibilities would necessitate numerous
articles. However, several ideas can be offered on
directions for organizational demography.
Deepening Variance Explanations
One direction is to further explicate and test relationships in current variance explanations (Mohr 1982) of
organizational demography. Instrumental, indicator,
and intervening process theories have been examined
in some detail. The following discussion provides examples of questions that other theories, such as moderator or antecedent theories, might generate.
Moderator theories, in which demographic variables
exert conditional effects on organizational outcomes,
offer some intriguing possibilities. The basic question
is: Under what conditions does a specific demographic
variable or set of demographic variables produce a
given outcome? For instance, scholars might explore
the conditions under which individuals experience similar (or different) effects based on their position along
different dimensions of a demographic variable. Tsui
et al. (1992) found that as an individual's age becomes
increasingly different from that of other people in his
or her work unit, the individual's intention to stay
decreases. Further, that result was independent of the
individual's age. In other words, both young and old
employees reacted the same way. The researchers did
not find such symmetric results for gender. As work
units became increasingly gender-diverse, men showed
decreasing and women showed increasing organiza-

tional commitment. What happens along other dimensions such as functional area, hierarchical level, or
prior industry experience?
Another moderator theory question involves the impact of diversity on organizational outcomes. For instance, demographic variables such as age, tenure, gender, race, and education seem likely to produce distinct
organizational outcomes. Yet demographic studies frequently treat such variables as an overall diversity
measure without theoretical development of the potentially distinct outcomes (e.g., see Pettigrew's 1992 discussion of this problem in the top management team
literature). Kanter's (1977b) important work on proportions in organizations does not address whether a racial
minority experiences the same intraorganizational
problems as a gender minority. Yet minority groups'
social status seems likely to generate differences in
their experiences. Such status differences might produce strong differences in the minority-group experiences of women and African Americans across regions
within the United States, as well as cross-nationally.
Antecedent theories, in which the demographic variable is causally prior to whatever variable predicts the
outcome, provide other interesting questions. Most organizational demographers ignore antecedent theories
completely because demographic variables hold no significant association with outcomes in these models.
One use for antecedent theories is in exploring how
demographic variables act as organizational signals
(Spence 1974) that acquire meaning, which differs from
the role demographic variables play in indicator theories. In indicator theories, the demographic variable
represents a measure of the subjective concept. In an
antecedent theory where demographic variables play a
signaling role, the demographic variable and subjective
concepts are conceptually distinct. The subjective concept is generated by the social constructs people attach
to their perceptions of the demographic variable.
Studies of the signaling relationship between reality
and perception may explain how demography influences organizational culture. Previous research
(Lawrence 1984, 1988, 1990, 1996) provides an example
of such signaling processes, suggesting that people use
their organization's age distribution as a signal of how
the firm values employees. For instance, people who
are seen as young in relation to others in the same job
are more likely to have "star" reputations and to
receive high performance ratings than people who are
seen as old. Thus, age demography influences organizational outcomes not because of the characteristics of
actual age, but because age acquires meaning when
people evaluate themselves and others. Interestingly,

17

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

managers' perceptions of their own age in relation to
that of others in the same position are frequently
inaccurate, but the perception rather than the reality is
what influences work attitudes and involvement. Studies of a broader range of signaling processes, organizational structures, and demographic distributions would
generate a detailed picture of the relationship between
formal and informal structure. Given that managers
control demography to some extent through recruitment, retention, and mobility, such understanding
might generate powerful intervention strategies.
Mixed theories, in which a given relationship between demographic variables and outcomes requires
several distinct explanations for complete specification,
provide perhaps the richest landscape for exploration.
Ancona and Caldwell (1992), for instance, found that a
team's diversity influenced performance both directly
and indirectly. Moreover, that influence operated differently for a team's tenure composition and its functional diversity. Tenure composition exerted a direct
impact on performance but no indirect impact. Directly, the more heterogeneous the team, the worse the
team's adherence to budget and schedule. Indirectly,
the more heterogeneous the team, the better the team's
internal processes. However, internal processes did not
predict adherence to budget and schedules as would be
expected in a complete intervening-process model. Because more than one theory is needed to explain these
results, the congruence assumption would have produced a Type II error: a positive association between
tenure composition and performance, even though the
predicted intervening process does not occur.
Functional diversity had both a direct and an indirect impact on performance. Directly, the greater the
group's functional diversity, the lower its managementrated innovation. Indirectly, the greater the group's
functional diversity, the greater its external communications and the higher its management-rated innovation. One cannot help but agree with Ancona and
Caldwell that "Taken together, these findings show the
complexity with which the demography of a group can
influence outcomes. Further, they suggest that our
models of group demography have to become more
clearly specified with respect to type of diversity, the
type of group process under investigation, the performance being assessed, and perhaps even the nature of
the group's task" (1992, p. 337).
Creating Dynamic Models
The second direction for organizational demographers
is to create dynamic models in which the relationship
between demographic predictors and organizational

18

outcomes is not explicitly unidirectional, linear, and
variance-capturing. One possibility is models that require nonrecursive explanations. In a dynamic model,
demographic variables might produce organizational
outcomes, then organizational outcomes might alter
the organization's demography, then a new relationship
between demographic variables and organizational outcomes might result, and so forth. One study (Lawrence
1988), for example, suggests that age distributions drive
the development of age norms, which in turn influence
employee behavior. However, this "does not imply that
reciprocal relationships do not occur. In fact, age norms
may influence age distributions, and employee behavior may alter age norms. For instance, over time, an
age effect such as managers' ratings of employees'
performance may influence the positions employees
hold, thus affecting the age distribution of those positions and the norms that develop" (pp. 313-314).
Kanter's (1977a, p. 63) notion of homosocial reproduction and Schneider's (1983, 1987) related attraction-selection-attrition model, in combination with the
relationship between heterogeneity and turnover
(McCain et al. 1983, Pfeffer 1983, Wagner et al. 1984),
suggest another dynamic model. Both Kanter and
Schneider suggest that employers tend to replace organizational members with people who are similar to
themselves. Even if we leave open the interesting question of whether this process is generated by situational
pressures, psychologically based decisions, or some
combination of the two, employers are likely to use
turnover to replace "different people" with "similar
people." Because heterogeneity seems to encourage
turnover, homosocial reproduction is likely to make
heterogeneous organizations more homogeneous over
time, and turnover will decline. Ultimately, the process
may produce a homogeneity equilibrium, a point at
which organizational members achieve a comfortable
balance of similar others. In this explanation, turnover
both results from demographic heterogeneity and creates demographic homogeneity.

Explaining What Factors Produce Organizational
Demographic Distributions
A third direction for organizational demographers is to
explicate those conditions that give rise to organizational distributions in the first place. Such research is a
staple in population demography, but organizational
scholars have done little thinking on this dynamic.
Several sets of questions are of interest. First, what
factors inside organizations influence organizational
distributions? Second, what factors outside organiza-

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

BARBARAS. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

tions influence organizational distributions? Inside the
organization, the dynamic processes cited above would
influence the organizational distributions that evolve
over time. Tolbert and Oberfield (1991) found that
employers' preferences for associating with certain social groups, although not posited as a dynamic process,
influenced organizational distributions. People are
more likely to hire employees with characteristics they
prefer, and an organization's demography reflects those
preferences. Outside the organization, Haveman (1995)
found that ecological processes such as organizational
births, deaths, mergers, and acquisitions within an industry exert little influence on tenure dispersion within
organizations. These processes do, however, influence
mean organizational tenure and job mobility. Wiersema
and Bird (1993) found that ethnological context, including national structural characteristics and culture,
alters the relationship between top management team
characteristics and turnover. Demographic heterogeneity explains more of the variation in top management
team turnover in Japan than in the United States.
Although research on antecedents of organizational
demographic distributions is limited, even the three
studies cited here suggest other questions. What other
internal and external factors influence organizational
distributions? Are ecological processes always ineffective as predictors of dispersion? Do changes in the
characteristics of the workforce influence the dispersion of those characteristics within organizations and, if
so, how? What is the relative impact of internal versus
external factors in producing organizational distributions? How do economic disruptions affect organizations demographically? Does the process by which a
demographic distribution is produced influence the
impact it has on outcomes that require indirect explanation? Certainly, considerable room is available for
detailed studies on a wide variety of intriguing questions.

Beyond the Variance Model
A final direction for organizational demographers is to
examine demographic theories in which the relationship between "predictors" and- organizational outcomes cannot be explained by partitioning the variation in outcomes. All organizational demography, including most of the discussion in this article, assumes a
variance explanation (Mohr 1982). In other words, it
assumes that if the right demographic predictors are
identified, they will consistently explain some percentage of the variation in organizational outcomes. However, process explanations, based on a narrative ap-

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl.

8, No. 1, January-February 1997

proach (Abbott 1992), may prove more appropriate.
For instance, average group tenure may explain little of
a group's social integration. Yet, in combination with
other factors such as stressful conditions, it may produce the correct primordial soup to push social integration over some threshold necessary to influence
performance. In other words, social integration may
explain little variation in performance unless the correct ordering of the correct conditions is achieved over
the correct time period. Consistent with other revolutionary change theories (Gersick 1991), a light push
from increasing group tenure at a given time may
produce dramatic changes in performance.
Pettigrew (1992) argues for process studies of elite
teams such as top management teams or boards of
directors, an area of study dominated by organizational
demographers. He suggests that process studies would
not replace, but would complement current cross-sectional studies. By focusing on temporal interconnectedness, multiple levels of analysis, and holistic as opposed
to linear explanations, process studies of elite teams
might examine questions such as "Why and how do
interlocking ties emerge, consolidate and dissolve?
What mixed motives are behind the offering and acceptance of multiboard membership? ... How are influence processes conducted in the network and is it
possible to unravel the place of influence processes
from coordination, information giving and control?"
(p. 177). These are only a few of many questions
provoked by eliminating the congruence assumption
and adopting a nonvariance explanation approach. Although no studies to date suggest such alternative
explanations, the possibility should not be discounted
in future thinking about demographic phenomena.
These several sets of questions do not provide exhaustive examples of new directions for demographic
studies, but they do represent some areas in which
organizational demography can continue making constructive and important contributions to organizational
studies.

Final Thoughts
This article is not just about organizational demography, but about all organizational theory. Neither good
measures devoid of explanation nor intriguing explanations lacking testable implications produce strong theory. One cannot answer the question "Why?" without
exploring the tight interdependence between theory
and method. Theories begin with notions about a phenomenon that emerge from many sources, such as

19

BARBARA S. LAWRENCE The Black Box of OrganizationalDemography

reading materials and personal observations. These
nascent theories are then tested, possibly with colleagues or an exploratory study. This step produces
more carefully specified, theories, which in turn are
subjected to further empirical confirmation, and so
forth. In truth, theories are always in progress, navigating iteratively, although perhaps not linearly, through
the territory between thought and experiment.
Strong theories provide clear directions for this navigation. They define location and heading by elaborating the current iteration. They denote distinctions from
previous thinking, provide boundaries on present ideas,
and foreshadow future destinations. Such theorizing
requires strict attention to method in its broadest sense:
the observing, relating, synthesizing, and explaining
that marks the theorizing process (Weick 1995). Kurt
Lewin's famous remark that "there is nothing so practical as a good theory" (Marrow 1969) is really recognition that good theories work precisely because of their
close connection to empirical observation. Strong theory does not exist without method, and our job as
scholars is to make that connection explicit.
It is in specifying this connection that organizational
demographers have fallen short. Demographers frequently invoke untested subjective concepts to explain
the relationship between demographic predictors and
organizational outcomes. The explanations are not necessarily wrong, but their explanatory gloss ignores the
self-correction of iterating theory with method. As a
result, untested subjective concepts remain poorly defined and their relationships, timing, and context consistently underspecified. Available data substantiate
this problem. The literature does not show reliable,
strong relationships between demographic predictors
and the subjective concepts commonly used to explain
organizational outcomes. Thus, the congruence assumption has produced weak theory: it creates a black
box whose contents remain unknown.
Despite this sometimes serious limitation, demographic variables are important for theoretical and
practical reasons. They represent a distinctive class of
theoretical concepts that frequently show predictive
value and are easy to measure. The challenge is to
develop stronger theory, to make sense of how and
under what conditions these structures work. When
data limitations preclude such explorations, researchers should provide careful specification of the
missing processes for future testing. The increasing
number of studies that do include tests of these
processes and conditional demographic effects suggests
a promising future for the field of organizational demography.

1This raises several questions. First, what kind of attributes should
organizational demography include: both demographic and personal
attributes or only demographic attributes? Second, what kind of
measures should organizational demography include: concepts defined by both simple and compositional measures or only concepts
defined by compositional measures? A look at how "real" population
demographers define their disciplinary boundaries provides some
perspective on these questions. Population demography examines the
"size, distribution, structure, and change of populations" (Shryock
et al. 1980, p. 2). In other words, population demographers describe
the current population composition, explore how it got the way it is,
and predict what it will be in the future. In its narrowest form,
population demography's definition includes only individual attributes such as age and gender. However, this constraint results
more from historical data limitations than from basic philosophy.
Population demographers now study almost any attribute relevant
for compositional study, including attitudes and other mutable individual characteristics (personal communication with Mark Hayward).
Organizational theorists are certainly not limited by how population demographers define their field; however, their definition does
suggest a broad view of attributes and a focus on compositional
rather than simple measures. Given such definitions, organizational
and population demography would be distinguished by two features.
Organizational demography uses compositional variables as theoretically distinct concepts, whereas population demography uses such
variables for their descriptive value only. In addition, organizational
demography does not at this time focus on describing and explaining
compositional change, whereas that is a primary goal of population
demography.
2These studies do not represent a complete list of works examining
the relationship between demographic predictors and subjective concepts. They were selected because they: (1) are generally considered
organizational demography studies, (2) are cited by organizational
demographers as evidence supporting a particular congruence assumption, or (3) examine the relationship between compositional
variables and subjective concepts. Although the included studies
focus on compositional demographic variables, some include simple
demographic variables, and predictions for both compositional and
simple variables are noted.
In many cases, a judgment call was made in deciding which
variables to include. For example, from Spangler et al. (1978) grades
earned and area of specialization were not included as subjective
concepts because they represent subjects' immutable characteristics.
From Cleveland et al. (1988) a subject's hiring recommendation was
not included as a subjective concept because it represents a decision.
From Glick et al. (1993) preference and belief diversity were not
included as demographic predictors because such mutable, personal
attributes are not typically defined as demographic variables.

3The levels-of-analysis issues discussed here are similar to those
presented in Klein et al. (1994, p. 198). The demographic unit is
similar to their "level of theory" in that the demographic unit
"describes the target (e.g., individual, group, organization) that a
theorist or researcher aims to depict and explain. It is 'the level to
which generalizations are made"' (Rousseau 1985, p. 4). The level of
analysis of the attribute is similar to their "level of measurement,"
which describes the actual source of the data: "the unit to which
data are directly attached (e.g., self-report data are generally individual level, the number of group members is measured at the group
level)" (Rousseau 1985, p. 4). Measures can be distinguished by using
Klein and her coauthor's assumptions of variability on the level of
theory. Simple measures assume the independence of the attribute's
level of analysis from the demographic unit. Compositional measures
assume either homogeneity (averages, coefficient of determination)
or heterogeneity (relational).
