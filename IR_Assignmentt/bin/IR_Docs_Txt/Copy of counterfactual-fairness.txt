Abstract
Machine learning can impact people with legal or ethical consequences when
it is used to automate decisions in areas such as insurance, lending, hiring, and
predictive policing. In many of these scenarios, previous decisions have been made
that are unfairly biased against certain subpopulations, for example those of a
particular race, gender, or sexual orientation. Since this past data may be biased,
machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating
discriminatory practices. In this paper, we develop a framework for modeling
fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness
captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it the same in
(a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged
to a different demographic group. We demonstrate our framework on a real-world
problem of fair prediction of success in law school.

Contribution

Machine learning has spread to fields as diverse as credit scoring [20], crime prediction [5], and loan
assessment [25]. Decisions in these areas may have ethical or legal implications, so it is necessary for
the modeler to think beyond the objective of maximizing prediction accuracy and consider the societal
impact of their work. For many of these applications, it is crucial to ask if the predictions of a model
are fair. Training data can contain unfairness for reasons having to do with historical prejudices or
other factors outside an individual’s control. In 2016, the Obama administration released a report2
which urged data scientists to analyze “how technologies can deliberately or inadvertently perpetuate,
exacerbate, or mask discrimination."
There has been much recent interest in designing algorithms that make fair predictions [4, 6, 10,
12, 14, 16–19, 22, 24, 36–39]. In large part, the literature has focused on formalizing fairness
into quantitative definitions and using them to solve a discrimination problem in a certain dataset.
Unfortunately, for a practitioner, law-maker, judge, or anyone else who is interested in implementing
algorithms that control for discrimination, it can be difficult to decide which definition of fairness to
choose for the task at hand. Indeed, we demonstrate that depending on the relationship between a
protected attribute and the data, certain definitions of fairness can actually increase discrimination.

In this paper, we introduce the first explicitly causal approach to address fairness. Specifically, we
leverage the causal framework of Pearl [30] to model the relationship between protected attributes
and data. We describe how techniques from causal inference can be effective tools for designing fair
algorithms and argue, as in DeDeo [9], that it is essential to properly address causality in fairness. In
perhaps the most closely related prior work, Johnson et al. [15] make similar arguments but from a
non-causal perspective. An alternative use of causal modeling in the context of fairness is introduced
independently by [21].
In Section 2, we provide a summary of basic concepts in fairness and causal modeling. In Section 3,
we provide the formal definition of counterfactual fairness, which enforces that a distribution over
possible predictions for an individual should remain unchanged in a world where an individual’s
protected attributes had been different in a causal sense. In Section 4, we describe an algorithm to
implement this definition, while distinguishing it from existing approaches. In Section 5, we illustrate
the algorithm with a case of fair assessment of law school success.

Background

This section provides a basic account of two separate areas of research in machine learning, which
are formally unified in this paper. We suggest Berk et al. [1] and Pearl et al. [29] as references.
Throughout this paper, we will use the following notation. Let A denote the set of protected attributes
of an individual, variables that must not be discriminated against in a formal sense defined differently
by each notion of fairness discussed. The decision of whether an attribute is protected or not is taken
as a primitive in any given problem, regardless of the definition of fairness adopted. Moreover, let
X denote the other observable attributes of any particular individual, U the set of relevant latent
attributes which are not observed, and let Y denote the outcome to be predicted, which itself might
be contaminated with historical biases. Finally, Ŷ is the predictor, a random variable that depends on
A, X and U , and which is produced by a machine learning algorithm as a prediction of Y .
2.1

Fairness

There has been much recent work on fair algorithms. These include fairness through unawareness
[12], individual fairness [10, 16, 24, 38], demographic parity/disparate impact [36], and equality of
opportunity [14, 37]. For simplicity we often assume A is encoded as a binary attribute, but this can
be generalized.
Definition 1 (Fairness Through Unawareness (FTU)). An algorithm is fair so long as any protected
attributes A are not explicitly used in the decision-making process.
Any mapping Ŷ : X → Y that excludes A satisfies this. Initially proposed as a baseline, the approach
has found favor recently with more general approaches such as Grgic-Hlaca et al. [12]. Despite its
compelling simplicity, FTU has a clear shortcoming as elements of X can contain discriminatory
information analogous to A that may not be obvious at first. The need for expert knowledge in
assessing the relationship between A and X was highlighted in the work on individual fairness:
Definition 2 (Individual Fairness (IF)). An algorithm is fair if it gives similar predictions to similar
individuals. Formally, given a metric d(·, ·), if individuals i and j are similar under this metric (i.e.,
d(i, j) is small) then their predictions should be similar: Ŷ (X (i) , A(i) ) ≈ Ŷ (X (j) , A(j) ).
As described in [10], the metric d(·, ·) must be carefully chosen, requiring an understanding of the
domain at hand beyond black-box statistical modeling. This can also be contrasted against population
level criteria such as
Definition 3 (Demographic Parity (DP)). A predictor Ŷ satisfies demographic parity if P (Ŷ |A =
0) = P (Ŷ |A = 1).

Definition 4 (Equality of Opportunity (EO)). A predictor Ŷ satisfies equality of opportunity if
P (Ŷ = 1|A = 0, Y = 1) = P (Ŷ = 1|A = 1, Y = 1).

These criteria can be incompatible in general, as discussed in [1, 7, 22]. Following the motivation of
IF and [15], we propose that knowledge about relationships between all attributes should be taken
into consideration, even if strong assumptions are necessary. Moreover, it is not immediately clear
2

for any of these approaches in which ways historical biases can be tackled. We approach such issues
from an explicit causal modeling perspective.
2.2

Causal Models and Counterfactuals

We follow Pearl [28], and define a causal model as a triple (U, V, F ) of sets such that
• U is a set of latent background variables,which are factors not caused by any variable in
the set V of observable variables;
• F is a set of functions {f1 , . . . , fn }, one for each Vi ∈ V , such that Vi = fi (pai , Upai ),
pai ⊆ V \{Vi } and Upai ⊆ U . Such equations are also known as structural equations [2].
The notation “pai ” refers to the “parents” of Vi and is motivated by the assumption that the model
factorizes as a directed graph, here assumed to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The model is causal
in that, given a distribution P (U ) over the background variables U , we can derive the distribution of a
subset Z ⊆ V following an intervention on V \ Z. An intervention on variable Vi is the substitution
of equation Vi = fi (pai , Upai ) with the equation Vi = v for some v. This captures the idea of an
agent, external to the system, modifying it by forcefully assigning value v to Vi , for example as in a
randomized experiment.
The specification of F is a strong assumption but allows for the calculation of counterfactual
quantities. In brief, consider the following counterfactual statement, “the value of Y if Z had taken
value z”, for two observable variables Z and Y . By assumption, the state of any observable variable is
fully determined by the background variables and structural equations. The counterfactual is modeled
as the solution for Y for a given U = u where the equations for Z are replaced with Z = z. We
denote it by YZ←z (u) [28], and sometimes as Yz if the context of the notation is clear.
Counterfactual inference, as specified by a causal model (U, V, F ) given evidence W , is the computation of probabilities P (YZ←z (U ) | W = w), where W , Z and Y are subsets of V . Inference proceeds
in three steps, as explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of Pearl et al. [29]: 1. Abduction: for a given
prior on U , compute the posterior distribution of U given the evidence W = w; 2. Action: substitute
the equations for Z with the interventional values z, resulting in the modified set of equations Fz ;
3. Prediction: compute the implied distribution on the remaining elements of V using Fz and the
posterior P (U |W = w).

Counterfactual Fairness

Given a predictive problem with fairness considerations, where A, X and Y represent the protected
attributes, remaining attributes, and output of interest respectively, let us assume that we are given a
causal model (U, V, F ), where V ≡ A ∪ X. We postulate the following criterion for predictors of Y .
Definition 5 (Counterfactual fairness). Predictor Ŷ is counterfactually fair if under any context
X = x and A = a,
P (ŶA←a (U ) = y | X = x, A = a) = P (ŶA←a0 (U ) = y | X = x, A = a),

(1)

for all y and for any value a0 attainable by A.

This notion is closely related to actual causes [13], or token causality in the sense that, to be fair,
A should not be a cause of Ŷ in any individual instance. In other words, changing A while holding
things which are not causally dependent on A constant will not change the distribution of Ŷ . We also
emphasize that counterfactual fairness is an individual-level definition. This is substantially different
from comparing different individuals that happen to share the same “treatment” A = a and coincide
on the values of X, as discussed in Section 4.3.1 of [29] and the Supplementary Material. Differences
between Xa and Xa0 must be caused by variations on A only. Notice also that this definition is
agnostic with respect to how good a predictor Ŷ is, which we discuss in Section 4.
Relation to individual fairness. IF is agnostic with respect to its notion of similarity metric, which
is both a strength (generality) and a weakness (no unified way of defining similarity). Counterfactuals
and similarities are related, as in the classical notion of distances between “worlds” corresponding to
different counterfactuals [23]. If Ŷ is a deterministic function of W ⊂ A ∪ X ∪ U , as in several of

our examples to follow, then IF can be defined by treating equally two individuals with the same W
in a way that is also counterfactually fair.
Relation to Pearl et al. [29]. In Example 4.4.4 of [29], the authors condition instead on X, A, and
the observed realization of Ŷ , and calculate the probability of the counterfactual realization ŶA←a0
differing from the factual. This example conflates the predictor Ŷ with the outcome Y , of which
we remain agnostic in our definition but which is used in the construction of Ŷ as in Section 4. Our
framing makes the connection to machine learning more explicit.
3.1

Examples

To provide an intuition for counterfactual fairness, we will consider two real-world fair prediction scenarios: insurance pricing and crime prediction. Each of these correspond to one of the two causal
graphs in Figure 1(a),(b). The Supplementary Material provides a more mathematical discussion of
these examples with more detailed insights.
Scenario 1: The Red Car. A car insurance company wishes to price insurance for car owners
by predicting their accident rate Y . They assume there is an unobserved factor corresponding to
aggressive driving U , that (a) causes drivers to be more likely have an accident, and (b) causes
individuals to prefer red cars (the observed variable X). Moreover, individuals belonging to a
certain race A are more likely to drive red cars. However, these individuals are no more likely to be
aggressive or to get in accidents than any one else. We show this in Figure 1(a). Thus, using the
red car feature X to predict accident rate Y would seem to be an unfair prediction because it may
charge individuals of a certain race more than others, even though no race is more likely to have an
accident. Counterfactual fairness agrees with this notion: changing A while holding U fixed will also
change X and, consequently, Ŷ . Interestingly, we can show (Supplementary Material) that in a linear
model, regressing Y on A and X is equivalent to regressing on U , so off-the-shelf regression here is
counterfactually fair. Regressing Y on X alone obeys the FTU criterion but is not counterfactually
fair, so omitting A (FTU) may introduce unfairness into an otherwise fair world.
Scenario 2: High Crime Regions. A city government wants to estimate crime rates by neighborhood to allocate policing resources. Its analyst constructed training data by merging (1) a registry of
residents containing their neighborhood X and race A, with (2) police records of arrests, giving each
resident a binary label with Y = 1 indicating a criminal arrest record. Due to historically segregated
housing, the location X depends on A. Locations X with more police resources have larger numbers
of arrests Y . And finally, U represents the totality of socioeconomic factors and policing practices
that both influence where an individual may live and how likely they are to be arrested and charged.
This can all be seen in Figure 1(b).
In this example, higher observed arrest rates in some neighborhoods are due to greater policing there,
not because people of different races are any more or less likely to break the law. The label Y = 0
4

does not mean someone has never committed a crime, but rather that they have not been caught. If
individuals in the training data have not already had equal opportunity, algorithms enforcing EO will
not remedy such unfairness. In contrast, a counterfactually fair approach would model differential
enforcement rates using U and base predictions on this information rather than on X directly.
In general, we need a multistage procedure in which we first derive latent variables U , and then based
on them we minimize some loss with respect to Y . This is the core of the algorithm discussed next.
3.2

Implications

One simple but important implication of the definition of counterfactual fairness is the following:
Lemma 1. Let G be the causal graph of the given model (U, V, F ). Then Ŷ will be counterfactually
fair if it is a function of the non-descendants of A.
Proof. Let W be any non-descendant of A in G. Then WA←a (U ) and WA←a0 (U ) have the same
distribution by the three inferential steps in Section 2.2. Hence, the distribution of any function Ŷ of
the non-descendants of A is invariant with respect to the counterfactual values of A.
This does not exclude using a descendant W of A as a possible input to Ŷ . However, this will only
be possible in the case where the overall dependence of Ŷ on A disappears, which will not happen in
general. Hence, Lemma 1 provides the most straightforward way to achieve counterfactual fairness.
In some scenarios, it is desirable to define path-specific variations of counterfactual fairness that allow
for the inclusion of some descendants of A, as discussed by [21, 27] and the Supplementary Material.
Ancestral closure of protected attributes. Suppose that a parent of a member of A is not in A.
Counterfactual fairness allows for the use of it in the definition of Ŷ . If this seems counterintuitive,
then we argue that the fault should be at the postulated set of protected attributes rather than with the
definition of counterfactual fairness, and that typically we should expect set A to be closed under
ancestral relationships given by the causal graph. For instance, if Race is a protected attribute, and
Mother’s race is a parent of Race, then it should also be in A.
Dealing with historical biases and an existing fairness paradox. The explicit difference between
Ŷ and Y allows us to tackle historical biases. For instance, let Y be an indicator of whether a client
defaults on a loan, while Ŷ is the actual decision of giving the loan. Consider the DAG A → Y ,
shown in Figure 1(c) with the explicit inclusion of set U of independent background variables. Y is
the objectively ideal measure for decision making, the binary indicator of the event that the individual
defaults on a loan. If A is postulated to be a protected attribute, then the predictor Ŷ = Y = fY (A, U )
is not counterfactually fair, with the arrow A → Y being (for instance) the result of a world that
punishes individuals in a way that is out of their control. Figure 1(d) shows a finer-grained model,
where the path is mediated by a measure of whether the person is employed, which is itself caused
by two background factors: one representing whether the person hiring is prejudiced, and the other
the employee’s qualifications. In this world, A is a cause of defaulting, even if mediated by other
variables3 . The counterfactual fairness principle however forbids us from using Y : using the twin
network 4 of Pearl [28], we see in Figure 1(e) that Ya and Ya0 need not be identically distributed
given the background variables.
In contrast, any function of variables not descendants of A can be used a basis for fair decision
making. This means that any variable Ŷ defined by Ŷ = g(U ) will be counterfactually fair for any
function g(·). Hence, given a causal model, the functional defined by the function g(·) minimizing
some predictive error for Y will satisfy the criterion, as proposed in Section 4.1. We are essentially
learning a projection of Y into the space of fair decisions, removing historical biases as a by-product.
Counterfactual fairness also provides an answer to some problems on the incompatibility of fairness
criteria. In particular, consider the following problem raised independently by different authors (e.g.,
3
For example, if the function determining employment fE (A, P, Q) ≡ I(Q>0,P =0 or A6=a) then an individual
with sufficient qualifications and prejudiced potential employer may have a different counterfactual employment
value for A = a compared to A = a0 , and a different chance of default.
4
In a nutshell, this is a graph that simultaneously depicts “multiple worlds” parallel to the factual realizations.
In this graph, all multiple worlds share the same background variables, but with different consequences in the
remaining variables depending on which counterfactual assignments are provided.

[7, 22]), illustrated below for the binary case: ideally, we would like our predictors to obey both
Equality of Opportunity and the predictive parity criterion defined by satisfying
P (Y = 1 | Ŷ = 1, A = 1) = P (Y = 1 | Ŷ = 1, A = 0),
as well as the corresponding equation for Ŷ = 0. It has been shown that if Y and A are marginally
associated (e.g., recidivism and race are associated) and Y is not a deterministic function of Ŷ ,
then the two criteria cannot be reconciled. Counterfactual fairness throws a light in this scenario,
suggesting that both EO and predictive parity may be insufficient if Y and A are associated: assuming
that A and Y are unconfounded (as expected for demographic attributes), this is the result of A being
a cause of Y . By counterfactual fairness, we should not want to use Y as a basis for our decisions,
instead aiming at some function Y⊥A of variables which are not caused by A but are predictive of Y .
Ŷ is defined in such a way that is an estimate of the “closest” Y⊥A to Y according to some preferred
risk function. This makes the incompatibility between EO and predictive parity irrelevant, as A and
Y⊥A will be independent by construction given the model assumptions.

4

Implementing Counterfactual Fairness

As discussed in the previous Section, we need to relate Ŷ to Y if the predictor is to be useful, and we
restrict Ŷ to be a (parameterized) function of the non-descendants of A in the causal graph following
Lemma 1. We next introduce an algorithm, then discuss assumptions that can be used to express
counterfactuals.
4.1

Algorithm

Let Ŷ ≡ gθ (U, XA ) be a predictor parameterized by θ, such as a logistic regression or a neural
network, and where XA ⊆ X are non-descendants of A. Given a loss function l(·, ·) such as
squared loss or log-likelihood, and training data D ≡ {(A(i) , X (i) , Y (i) )} for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we

define L(θ) ≡ i=1 E[l(y (i) , gθ (U (i) , xA )) | x(i) , a(i) ]/n as the empirical loss to be minimized

with respect to θ. Each expectation is with respect to random variable U (i) ∼ PM (U | x(i) , a(i) )
where PM (U | x, a) is the conditional distribution of the background variables as given by a causal
model M that is available by assumption. If this expectation cannot be calculated analytically,
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be used to approximate it as in the following algorithm.

Deconvolution perspective. The algorithm can be understood as a deconvolution approach that,
given observables A ∪ X, extracts its latent sources and pipelines them into a predictive model. We
advocate that counterfactual assumptions must underlie all approaches that claim to extract the
sources of variation of the data as “fair” latent components. As an example, Louizos et al. [24] start
from the DAG A → X ← U to extract P (U | X, A). As U and A are not independent given X in this
representation, a type of penalization is enforced to create a posterior Pf air (U |A, X) that is close
to the model posterior P (U | A, X) while satisfying Pf air (U |A = a, X) ≈ Pf air (U |A = a0 , X).
But this is neither necessary nor sufficient for counterfactual fairness. The model for X given A
and U must be justified by a causal mechanism, and that being the case, P (U | A, X) requires no
postprocessing. As a matter of fact, model M can be learned by penalizing empirical dependence
measures between U and pai for a given Vi (e.g. Mooij et al. [26]), but this concerns M and not Ŷ ,
and is motivated by explicit assumptions about structural equations, as described next.

4.2

Designing the Input Causal Model

Model M must be provided to algorithm FAIR L EARNING. Although this is well understood, it is
worthwhile remembering that causal models always require strong assumptions, even more so when
making counterfactual claims [8]. Counterfactuals assumptions such as structural equations are in
general unfalsifiable even if interventional data for all variables is available. This is because there
are infinitely many structural equations compatible with the same observable distribution [28], be it
observational or interventional. Having passed testable implications, the remaining components of a
counterfactual model should be understood as conjectures formulated according to the best of our
knowledge. Such models should be deemed provisional and prone to modifications if, for example,
new data containing measurement of variables previously hidden contradict the current model.
We point out that we do not need to specify a fully deterministic model, and structural equations can
be relaxed as conditional distributions. In particular, the concept of counterfactual fairness holds
under three levels of assumptions of increasing strength:
Level 1. Build Ŷ using only the observable non-descendants of A. This only requires partial
causal ordering and no further causal assumptions, but in many problems there will be few, if any,
observables which are not descendants of protected demographic factors.
Level 2. Postulate background latent variables that act as non-deterministic causes of observable
variables, based on explicit domain knowledge and learning algorithms5 . Information about X is
passed to Ŷ via P (U | x, a).

Level 3. Postulate a fully deterministic model with latent variables. For instance, the distribution
P (Vi | pai ) can be treated as an additive error model, Vi = fi (pai )+ei [31]. The error term ei then
becomes an input to Ŷ as calculated from the observed variables. This maximizes the information
extracted by the fair predictor Ŷ .
4.3

Further Considerations on Designing the Input Causal Model

One might ask what we can lose by defining causal fairness measures involving only noncounterfactual causal quantities, such as enforcing P (Ŷ = 1 | do(A = a)) = P (Ŷ = 1 | do(A = a0 ))
instead of our counterfactual criterion. The reason is that the above equation is only a constraint
on an average effect. Obeying this criterion provides no guarantees against, for example, having
half of the individuals being strongly “negatively” discriminated and half of the individuals strongly
“positively” discriminated. We advocate that, for fairness, society should not be satisfied in pursuing
only counterfactually-free guarantees. While one may be willing to claim posthoc that the equation
above masks no balancing effect so that individuals receive approximately the same distribution of
outcomes, that itself is just a counterfactual claim in disguise. Our approach is to make counterfactual
assumptions explicit. When unfairness is judged to follow only some “pathways” in the causal graph
(in a sense that can be made formal, see [21, 27]), nonparametric assumptions about the independence
of counterfactuals may suffice, as discussed by [27]. In general, nonparametric assumptions may not
provide identifiable adjustments even in this case, as also discussed in our Supplementary Material.
If competing models with different untestable assumptions are available, there are ways of simultaneously enforcing a notion of approximate counterfactual fairness in all of them, as introduced by us in
[32]. Other alternatives include exploiting bounds on the contribution of hidden variables [29, 33].
Another issue is the interpretation of causal claims involving demographic variables such as race
and sex. Our view is that such constructs are the result of translating complex events into random
variables and, despite some controversy, we consider counterproductive to claim that e.g. race and sex
cannot be causes. An idealized intervention on some A at a particular time can be seen as a notational
shortcut to express a conjunction of more specific interventions, which may be individually doable
but jointly impossible in practice. It is the plausibility of complex, even if impossible to practically
manipulate, causal chains from A to Y that allows us to claim that unfairness is real [11]. Experiments
for constructs exist, such as randomizing names in job applications to make them race-blind. They do
not contradict the notion of race as a cause, and can be interpreted as an intervention on a particular
aspect of the construct “race,” such as “race perception” (e.g. Section 4.4.4 of [29]).
5

In some domains, it is actually common to build a model entirely around latent constructs with few or no
observable parents nor connections among observed variables [2].

Illustration: Law School Success

We illustrate our approach on a practical problem that requires fairness, the prediction of success in
law school. A second problem, understanding the contribution of race to police stops, is described in
the Supplementary Material. Following closely the usual framework for assessing causal models in
the machine learning literature, the goal of this experiment is to quantify how our algorithm behaves
with finite sample sizes while assuming ground truth compatible with a synthetic model.
Problem definition: Law school success
The Law School Admission Council conducted a survey across 163 law schools in the United States
[35]. It contains information on 21,790 law students such as their entrance exam scores (LSAT), their
grade-point average (GPA) collected prior to law school, and their first year average grade (FYA).
Given this data, a school may wish to predict if an applicant will have a high FYA. The school would
also like to make sure these predictions are not biased by an individual’s race and sex. However, the
LSAT, GPA, and FYA scores, may be biased due to social factors. We compare our framework with
two unfair baselines: 1. Full: the standard technique of using all features, including sensitive features
such as race and sex to make predictions; 2. Unaware: fairness through unawareness, where we
do not use race and sex as features. For comparison, we generate predictors Ŷ for all models using
logistic regression.
Fair prediction. As described in Section 4.2, there are three ways in which we can model a
counterfactually fair predictor of FYA. Level 1 uses any features which are not descendants of race
and sex for prediction. Level 2 models latent ‘fair’ variables which are parents of observed variables.
These variables are independent of both race and sex. Level 3 models the data using an additive error
model, and uses the independent error terms to make predictions. These models make increasingly
strong assumptions corresponding to increased predictive power. We split the dataset 80/20 into a
train/test set, preserving label balance, to evaluate the models.
As we believe LSAT, GPA, and FYA are all biased by race and sex, we cannot use any observed
features to construct a counterfactually fair predictor as described in Level 1.
In Level 2, we postulate that a latent variable: a student’s knowledge (K), affects GPA, LSAT, and
FYA scores. The causal graph corresponding to this model is shown in Figure 2, (Level 2). This is a
short-hand for the distributions:
K
R
S
GPA ∼ N (bG + wG
K + wG
R + wG
S, σG ),
K
R
S
LSAT ∼ Poisson(exp(bL + wL K + wL R + wL
S)),

FYA ∼ N (wFK K + wFR R + wFS S, 1),
K ∼ N (0, 1)

We perform inference on this model using an observed training set to estimate the posterior distribution
of K. We use the probabilistic programming language Stan [34] to learn K. We call the predictor
constructed using K, Fair K.

In Level 3, we model GPA, LSAT, and FYA as continuous variables with additive error terms
independent of race and sex (that may in turn be correlated with one-another). This model is shown

accuracy to ensuring counterfactually fair prediction (Fair K, Fair Add), versus the models that use
unfair features: GPA, LSAT, race, sex (Full, Unaware).

GPA = bG + wG
R + wG

S
LSAT = bL + wL
R + wL
S + L , L ∼ p(L )

FYA = bF + wFR R + wFS S + F , F ∼ p(F )

We estimate the error terms G , L by first fitting two models that each use race and sex to individually
predict GPA and LSAT. We then compute the residuals of each model (e.g., G = GPA− ŶGPA (R, S)).
We use these residual estimates of G , L to predict FYA. We call this Fair Add.
Accuracy. We compare the RMSE achieved by logistic regression for each of the models on the test
set in Table 1. The Full model achieves the lowest RMSE as it uses race and sex to more accurately
reconstruct FYA. Note that in this case, this model is not fair even if the data was generated by one of
the models shown in Figure 2 as it corresponds to Scenario 3. The (also unfair) Unaware model still
uses the unfair variables GPA and LSAT, but because it does not use race and sex it cannot match the
RMSE of the Full model. As our models satisfy counterfactual fairness, they trade off some accuracy.
Our first model Fair K uses weaker assumptions and thus the RMSE is highest. Using the Level 3
assumptions, as in Fair Add we produce a counterfactually fair model that trades slightly stronger
assumptions for lower RMSE.
Counterfactual fairness. We would like to empirically test whether the baseline methods are
counterfactually fair. To do so we will assume the true model of the world is given by Figure 2,
(Level 2). We can fit the parameters of this model using the observed data and evaluate counterfactual
fairness by sampling from it. Specifically, we will generate samples from the model given either
the observed race and sex, or counterfactual race and sex variables. We will fit models to both the
original and counterfactual sampled data and plot how the distribution of predicted FYA changes for
both baseline models. Figure 2 shows this, where each row corresponds to a baseline predictor and
each column corresponds to the counterfactual change. In each plot, the blue distribution is density of
predicted FYA for the original data and the red distribution is this density for the counterfactual data. If
a model is counterfactually fair we would expect these distributions to lie exactly on top of each other.
Instead, we note that the Full model exhibits counterfactual unfairness for all counterfactuals except
sex. We see a similar trend for the Unaware model, although it is closer to being counterfactually
fair. To see why these models seem to be fair w.r.t. to sex we can look at weights of the DAG which
generates the counterfactual data. Specifically the DAG weights from (male,female) to GPA are
(0.93,1.06) and from (male,female) to LSAT are (1.1,1.1). Thus, these models are fair w.r.t. to sex
simply because of a very weak causal link between sex and GPA/LSAT.

Conclusion

We have presented a new model of fairness we refer to as counterfactual fairness. It allows us
to propose algorithms that, rather than simply ignoring protected attributes, are able to take into
account the different social biases that may arise towards individuals based on ethically sensitive
attributes and compensate for these biases effectively. We experimentally contrasted our approach
with previous fairness approaches and show that our explicit causal models capture these social biases
and make clear the implicit trade-off between prediction accuracy and fairness in an unfair world. We
propose that fairness should be regulated by explicitly modeling the causal structure of the world.
Criteria based purely on probabilistic independence cannot satisfy this and are unable to address how
unfairness is occurring in the task at hand. By providing such causal tools for addressing fairness
questions we hope we can provide practitioners with customized techniques for solving a wide array
of fairness modeling problems.
