age of the review, helpfulness votes and whether the reviews
are from veriﬁed purchases (Bishop 2015). Some other platforms, like Yelp (Yelp 2010), calculate a business rating by
computing a raw average of customer reviews, but only of
reviews that their rating algorithms classify as authentic or
“not fake.” While we understand the overview of these algorithms, their details are proprietary.
The power and opaqueness of algorithmic rating systems
have raised concerns about the bias they might introduce
into online ratings. As an example, in May 2016, Australian
Uber drivers accused the company of slowly decreasing
their ratings to suspend them and then charge higher commissions to be reinstated. The president of the Ride Share
Drivers’ Association of Australia noted that “the lack of
transparency makes it entirely possible for Uber to manipulate the ratings” (Tucker 2016). Other algorithmic rating
systems such as Yelp (Fowler 2011) and Fandago (Hickey
2015) have faced similar criticisms, as have other algorithmic systems including search engines (Hannak et al. 2013;
Kliman-Silver et al. 2015; Kulshrestha et al. 2017), online advertising (Sweeney 2013; Datta, Tschantz, and Datta
2015) and e-commerce websites (Hannak et al. 2014). These
issues have given rise to a growing area of research, designing algorithms audits, that aims to detect algorithmic systems’ potential biases (Sandvig et al. 2014).
Detecting the existence of bias in an algorithmic system,
however, is not sufﬁcient to understand its impact on users.
An important factor in discovering the effects of an unjust or
biased algorithm is understanding users’ awareness of and
behavior around it. Recent studies have investigated users’
awareness of and interaction with algorithms — including
news feed curation algorithms (Eslami et al. 2015; 2016;
Rader and Gray 2015) and ridesharing management algorithms (Lee et al. 2015) — but how users perceive and manage the bias that an algorithm brings to their online experience is an open question.
In this paper, we seek to ﬁll these gaps by investigating algorithmic bias and users’ awareness of and behavior
around the bias in hotel rating platforms. An initial study
suggested that a potential bias on a hotel rating platform
(Booking.com) skewed low review scores upwards. To analyze this potential bias, we used a cross-platform audit technique comparing the outputs of Booking.com and two other
popular hotel rating platforms. Analyzing the ratings of 803

Abstract
Awareness of bias in algorithms is growing among scholars
and users of algorithmic systems. But what can we observe
about how users discover and behave around such biases?
We used a cross-platform audit technique that analyzed online ratings of 803 hotels across three hotel rating platforms
and found that one site’s algorithmic rating system biased ratings, particularly low-to-medium quality hotels, signiﬁcantly
higher than others (up to 37%). Analyzing reviews of 162
users who independently discovered this bias, we seek to understand if, how, and in what ways users perceive and manage
this bias. Users changed the typical ways they used a review
on a hotel rating platform to instead discuss the rating system
itself and raise other users’ awareness of the rating bias. This
raising of awareness included practices like efforts to reverseengineer the rating algorithm, efforts to correct the bias, and
demonstrations of broken trust. We conclude with a discussion of how such behavior patterns might inform design approaches that anticipate unexpected bias and provide reliable
means for meaningful bias discovery and response.

Introduction
Algorithms are powerful. They collect, process, and present
information in today’s online world; and in doing so, they
exert inﬂuence over users’ interaction with the system. Rating algorithms are one example that their outputs — i.e.,
business ratings based on online reviews — signiﬁcantly impact users’ behavior and accordingly the success of a business. A simple half-star improvement on a Yelp rating, for
instance, results in a 30-49% higher likelihood of selling out
the seats for a restaurant (Anderson and Magruder 2012).
While rating algorithms are inﬂuential, little about how
they work is made public. These algorithms’ internal processes, and sometimes their inputs, are usually housed in
black boxes, both to protect intellectual property and to prevent reviewers from gaming business ratings. Computing a
raw average of users’ reviews is a simple way to calculate a
business rating; however, many rating platforms do not use
this approach. Amazon, for instance, calculates a product’s
overall rating by taking into account factors including the

hotels showed that Booking.com’s rating system biased ratings of hotels, particularly low-to-medium quality hotels, to
be signiﬁcantly higher than other platforms (up to 37%).
We employed a mixed-method design to study users’ behavior around this bias. First, we applied a computational
technique to identify the users who noticed the bias; next,
we conducted qualitative analysis over their reviews to understand how users behaved around the bias. We found 162
users who independently discovered the algorithm’s bias
through their regular use. These users, rather than contributing the usual review content (i.e., informing other users
about their hotel stay experience), adopted an “auditing”
practice. When confronted by a higher than intended review
score, they used their review to raise the bias awareness of
other users on the site. To do so, they wrote about how they:
engaged in activities such as trying to manipulate the algorithm’s inputs to look into its black-box, tried to correct the
bias manually, and illustrated a breakdown of trust.
While the work we present here focuses on rating algorithms, we are more broadly concerned with the role of algorithmic bias and users’ behavior around it in non-transparent
algorithmic systems in general. We conclude with connections to both theory and design. We discuss how bias awareness can shift users’ attention from their own experience to
the system as a whole; this suggests the possibility of users
collaborating to bring an algorithmic bias to the surface via
a “collective audit.” We also explore design approaches that
bring actionable transparency to algorithmic systems, building a more trustworthy and engaging interaction between
users and the system.

nature of algorithms, however, makes auditing them difﬁcult. Therefore, many algorithm audits are designed to detect algorithm bias “from the outside.” Here, we categorize these techniques, depending on whether an audit is performed within one platform or across two or more platforms.

Auditing Algorithms: Techniques and Challenges

Within-Platform Audits In within-platform audit techniques, researchers issue queries as inputs to an algorithmic system and analyze the outputs. For example, Sweeney
searched more than 2000 racially-associated personal names
online and found that ads suggesting arrest were 25%
more likely to appear for Black-identifying names (Sweeney
2013). Researchers also use scraping to audit, writing a
script to conduct such processes automatically and at scale
(Sandvig et al. 2014). Investigating the potential biases of
online maps in representing international borders (Soeller et
al. 2016) and exploring the sources of bias in social media
search are some examples.
Generating or collecting inputs to feed an algorithmic system is challenging, however, particularly if the input of an algorithm is a real user’s proﬁle. To overcome this challenge,
some studies use a “sock puppet” technique (Sandvig et al.
2014), in which researchers create fake users’ proﬁles as inputs to an algorithm to analyze its outputs and investigate
bias. Examples of this type of audit include creating browser
agents as simulated users to detect gender bias in online
advertising (Datta, Tschantz, and Datta 2015), understanding the Uber surge pricing algorithm by emulating Uber accounts (Chen, Mislove, and Wilson 2015), and discovering
racial discrimination against Black users on Airbnb via creating multiple accounts (Edelman, Luca, and Svirsky 2015).
Some have used this technique to understand which speciﬁc
input data in a real user’s proﬁle maps to outputs (e.g., ads
and recommendations) by associating shadow and real user
accounts and comparing the outputs (Lécuyer et al. 2014).
Scraping and sock puppet audit techniques may be difﬁcult or even illegal to use under a platform’s terms of service (ToS). As ToS are included in the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act (CFAA), violations may be labeled a federal
crime. Therefore, some researchers recruit real users (similar to traditional audits) to use an algorithmic system to analyze the outputs and detect potential biases. This method,
the “crowdsourced audit” (Sandvig et al. 2014), has been
used by researchers to examine personalization algorithms
in Google search (Hannak et al. 2013; Kliman-Silver et al.
2015) and e-commerce websites (Hannak et al. 2014). While
effective, it is difﬁcult to implement at scale.

The presence of biases in algorithmic platforms has opened
up new approaches for interrogating algorithms. In “algorithm audits” researchers employ different techniques inspired by traditional audit studies (such as ﬁeld experiments
to detect realtors’ racial discrimination in choosing which
homes to present to clients) to understand biases or illegal
behaviors an algorithm might introduce to a system (Sandvig et al. 2014). The potential risks of biased algorithms have
also prompted governments to call for regulation of algorithmic systems in an attempt to increase algorithmic transparency and prevent discrimination via algorithms (Goodman and Flaxman 2016; WhiteHouse 2016). The black box

Cross-Platform Audits The main goal of within-platform
audits is to see if an algorithm behaves differently across
some categories of inputs when it should not (e.g., showing more arrest records for Black people or higher prices
for users in poor neighborhoods). But what if an algorithmic
system biases all its inputs? Detecting such biases is difﬁcult with a within-platform audit. Auditing across platforms
allows the detection of bias that skews all inputs, by comparing outputs of an algorithmic system with the outputs of
other systems that have a similar intent.
However, while previous work compared different algorithmic systems’ outputs around the same input, the goal

Algorithms And Bias
Algorithms help us to interact with large amounts of data
by automating the curation of online content (Lustig et al.
2016). They are not, however, infallible; they might introduce bias into a system due to their probabilistic nature,
imperfect human logic used in their development, or nonrepresentative input or training data from biased individuals
(Seaver 2013; Diakopoulos 2014). Such biases, regardless of
their source, might result in unintended consequences with
negative impacts, like an image tagging algorithm labelling
images of Black people with tags such as “ape” (Hern 2015),
and arguments over whether the Chicago’s police crime prediction algorithm is racist (Stroud 2014).

was not to audit the algorithms. For example, Muddiman
compared search engines’ results for the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates to gain a holistic insight into how search
engines organize political information during campaigns,
but not to detect potential biases in these algorithmic systems. (Muddiman 2013)). Recently, however, some journalists have started to use cross-platform audit techniques to
detect bias in algorithmic platforms. An example is ﬁnding that Fandango’s rating algorithm skewed their movie ratings upwards in comparison to other movie rating platforms
(Hickey 2015). Inspired by such journalistic investigations,
our work uses a cross-platform audit to investigate potential
bias in online hotel rating systems.

Users’ Behavior around (Biased) Algorithms
Detecting an algorithm’s bias is the ﬁrst step toward understanding its impacts. However, detection alone is not
enough. Understanding whether users are aware of algorithmic biases and how they perform around such biases is important for perceiving the possible effects of algorithmic bias
not only on the platform but also on users’ experiences.
In some cases, the signiﬁcance of an algorithm’s bias can
be truly understood by analyzing users’ behavior around it.
For example, the “Up Next” YouTube algorithm that recommends additional videos appears benign at ﬁrst glance.
However, an incident catalyzed by the “Reply Girls”, highlighted how it could be biased. A group of users, the “Reply
Girls,” speculated that this algorithm prioritized videos labeled replies to a video in the “Up Next” list. By uploading
sexually suggestive videos as replies to popular videos, they
increased their view number and, as a result, their ad sharing
revenue. Many YouTube users began campaigning against
the “Reply Girls” via Youtube channels, and YouTube modiﬁed its algorithm to resolve this issue (O’Neill 2012). This
algorithmic bias, however, may not have been addressed if
the audience did not detect it and react against it.
Recent studies have discussed the importance of understanding users’ awareness of and their behavior around algorithms (Hamilton et al. 2014; Barocas, Hood, and Ziewitz
2013). Analyzing human workers’ interaction with algorithmic management in ridesharing services Uber and Lyft
(Lee et al. 2015), users’ awareness and their understanding
of Facebook’s News Feed curation algorithm (Eslami et al.
2015; Rader and Gray 2015) and the practices they use to
make sense of it (Eslami et al. 2016) are some examples.
However, there is still little understanding about users’ behavior around biased or misleading algorithms. We seek to
improve this understanding by analyzing how users understand and manage the bias of an algorithmic rating system.

tel on Booking.com, users cannot provide an overall score,
but instead are asked to rate different criteria such as location and staff. The rating algorithm then calculates an aggregate review score for the user (Booking.com 2015). However, while Booking.com’s overall review interface suggests
a lowest possible score of 1, the lowest possible output of the
scoring algorithm is a 2.5 (Figure 1). That is, even if a user
rates all the criteria of a hotel at the lowest value, the aggregate rating returned by the algorithm is a 2.5. To understand
how much bias this discrepancy introduces to hotels’ overall
ratings and how users behave around it, we ask the following
research questions:

Case Study: Rating Algorithms

RQ1: How much bias does Booking.com’s algorithmic
rating system introduce to businesses’ ratings?

Rating systems are one type of algorithmic system that have
been suspected of being biased due to their black-box nature
and their inﬂuence over business ratings. Some users, particularly business owners, argue that hidden rating algorithms
might misrepresent ratings in favor of or against some businesses or products (Fowler 2011; Hickey 2015).
Booking.com is one rating platform that our initial study
suggested is biased in its rating algorithm. When rating a ho-

Bias Detection and Quantiﬁcation (RQ1)
To understand whether and how the inﬂation of the lowest
possible review score on Booking.com introduces bias to
overall hotel ratings1 , we employed a cross-platform audit
technique. Since inﬂating the minimum scores might be a result of an inﬂation of all inputs, using a cross-platform rather
than within-platform audit is necessary (as there would otherwise be no ground-truth for comparison). A cross-platform
audit requires speciﬁc hotel’s reviews and ratings from different platforms. Many websites aggregate hotel deals from
travel websites; such sites, which refer to themselves as hotel
metasearch engines, search several hotel booking websites
to help users compare hotels across them. One metasearch
engine, HotelsCombined.com, provides direct links to hotels’ proﬁles, including their reviews and ratings from different hotel rating platforms. This site served as the data source
for our study.
We collected hotel information from HotelsCombined.com for every hotel in ten random cities in the U.S.2 ,
leading to an initial set of 1576 hotels. We excluded any hotels that had not been rated on Booking.com and two other
hotel rating platforms— Expedia.com and Hotels.com —
which are among the top 10 most-used hotel booking websites3 . The ﬁnal corpus contained 803 hotels that were rated
on all three hotel rating platforms. As the scales of rating
platforms differ, we mapped all values to the same range
(maintaining the ratio) for comparison.

and higher quality hotels. Higher quality hotels were those
with ratings above 7; lower quality hotels were all remaining hotels. For each pair of signiﬁcantly different platforms
(Boooking.com and Expedia.com, Booking.com and Hotels.com), we measured the percentage difference of each
hotel’s rating. For example, if a hotel was rated 4.5 on Booking and 4 on Expedia.com, the difference measure would
be 12.5%. A one-sample t-test on each group found that
the difference between Booking.com and each of the other
platforms is signiﬁcant, with a mean difference (M) of up
to 37% for lower quality hotels and around 5% for higher
quality hotels, with large effect sizes (Table 1). These results indicate that Booking.com’s rating system biased ratings of hotels higher than the other platforms in general. In
doing so, Booking.com beneﬁts hotels, particularly low-tomedium quality hotels.
We note that a cross-platform audit technique cannot distinguish whether a bias in the outputs of an algorithmic system arises from its inputs, the algorithm itself, or both. For
example, Booking.com, Expedia.com, and Hotels.com each
have their own audience, interface design (e.g., 5- vs 10-star
rating scales) which can impact the inputs to their rating algorithms. Given these inherent differences between rating
systems, we cannot claim the bias in Booking.com rating is
only a result of its algorithm. We term this bias an “algorithmic system bias” rather than an “algorithm bias” because
other elements of the Booking.com algorithmic rating system such as its inputs and users might play a role in creating
this bias.
However, even without identifying the source of this bias,
detecting it is important because of its impact. On aggregator systems such as HotelsCombined.com, users see different rating systems’ outputs on the same page. They may assume that a 5.0 on one site is comparable to a 5.0 on another
because of this presentation. But they do not see the original inputs or algorithms used in the respective sites. So even
though we cannot determine whether it is Booking.com’s
rating algorithm alone or also input differences (e.g., the different users across each platform, different timestamps for
the reviews) causing the bias, knowing that a bias exists may
serve as a signal to users and help inform their interactions.

Augmented Hotel Ratings
An ANOVA analysis showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference between hotel ratings in the three hotel rating platforms
(F (2, 2406) = 39.9, p < 0.0001). To discover which rating
platforms were signiﬁcantly different, we used a Tukey post
hoc test. It revealed that Booking.com’s hotel ratings were
signiﬁcantly different from ratings of both Expedia.com
(p < 0.01) and Hotels.com (p < 0.01). There was, however,
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the ratings of
Expedia.com and Hotels.com (p = 0.07).
Figure 2 shows the ratings on Booking.com and the other
platforms. Hotels with a rating lower than 7 (low-to-medium
quality hotels that Booking.com considers below “good”)
show larger differences across platforms. To better understand this difference, we ran separate analyses on the lower

absolutely nothing about this accommodation” (R5). They
assigned the minimum subscore to each evaluation criteria
and expected a standard minimum ﬁnal score (1 or 0) that
never appeared. This mismatch led them to suggest the rating bias: “I rated this motel at 0, but the review program enters 2.5 as the low limit, so be careful; things can be worse
than they appear” (R98).
Reviewers with higher scores than 2.5 (n=50), up to 8.8,
also found the calculated score did not match their desired
score: “Although the above rating indicates a 3.8, I would
personally rate it about a 1.5 ” (R55). Our initial hypothesis was that these reviewers had previously written 2.5-score
reviews while expecting a lower score, discovered the bias,
and reﬂected their ﬁnding in their next review(s). However,
more than half of these users had only written one review
with a score higher than 2.5 and still discovered the bias.
These reviewers realized that “the way [their] score is calculated doesn’t give a good idea of the overall notation” (R93).

Rating platforms are designed for users to rate a third-party
business; for example, Google’s app store allows users to
write reviews for applications to provide feedback about
an app’s issues. Researchers have used these types of reviews to detect usability issues in a system (Keertipati,
Savarimuthu, and Licorish 2016). In this vein, we investigate
whether users in a biased system use reviews intended for
third-parties to review the system itself; i.e. whether Booking.com’s users use reviews that are supposed to be about
hotels to instead review Booking.com itself.
To understand whether there were users who were aware
of Booking.com’s rating bias and who mentioned it in their
reviews, we studied user reviews from the hotels collected
in the previous step. One possible method for becoming
aware of a bias was to note the unintended aggregate 2.5
score when a 1 was expected. We, therefore, focused on reviews with a score of 2.5. Of 100 random reviews with a 2.5
score, eight articulated the bias to the community in their
review; the reviewers described their negative hotel stay experience along with an explanation for why they suspected
their review score was not the lowest possible score: “Disgusting, roaches, uncomfortable beds[;] review needs to be
less then[sic] 2.5 stars but [the system] won’t let me” (R66).
This ﬁnding inspired an expansion to study more reviews,
including those with higher scores. However, the list of every Booking.com review ever written is quite long. To direct our investigation, we developed a method inspired by
bootstrapping methods that start from one seed and then expand.We ﬁrst extracted the three most common keywords
(“2.5”, “lowest”, and “score”) found in our initial set of
2.5 rated reviews. We then searched for these keywords altogether using Google search (specifying a Booking.com
search domain). We devised a coding scheme to describe
which reviewers discovered the bias. With our code, a reviewer was labeled as aware of the bias if they articulated i)
a discrepancy between their intended review score and what
the system calculated and/or ii) the observation that 2.5 is
the lowest possible score on Booking.com.
Manually reading the top 200 search results, we identiﬁed reviewers with reviews that our code labeled as aware.
We added these reviews to our set of reviews and repeated
this process, extracting the three most common keywords
from the new review set, searching for reviews that contained these keywords on Booking.com and coding the results. After ten iterations and over 2000 reviews, we found
162 reviewers who discussed the rating bias in their reviews.
But how did these reviewers become aware of the bias?

To understand users’ behavior around the bias once they
were aware of it, we analyzed users’ reviews using an inductive, iterative process via line-by-line open coding. First,
we read all the reviews several times, before labeling each
review with preliminary codes to help organize our initial
insights. These codes included a set of primary themes such
as announcing a mismatched review score, manipulating the
algorithm, or asking for a change in the rating system.
Second, we analyzed the codes themselves to ﬁnd similarities, grouping them into categories based on common
properties. We arrived at three main themes. The ﬁrst theme
revolves around users’ attempts to understand how the algorithm works. The second focuses on users’ efforts to correct
the bias. The third addresses the breakdown of trust between
users and the system as a whole due to the bias.
Last, we conducted axial coding, analyzing the interrelationships among the themes that we had identiﬁed. We found
a common theme in all three: raising awareness through situated actions. Users changed their usual practices around
the reviews — instead of only informing other users about
their hotel stay experience, they sought to raise other users’
awareness of the rating bias. This change of action resonates
with Suchman’s idea of “situated action” in which users adjust their behavior depending on what is actually happening
in an interaction with a system in a speciﬁc situation (Suchman 1987). We describe the three main themes and how the
practice of raising awareness is embedded in each below.

Becoming Aware

Looking into the Black Box

Behaving around the Bias (RQ3)

For all of the 162 reviewers who discussed a bias in their
reviews, a review score that did not match their stay experience was a prompt to discover the bias. For example,
their reviews contained statements such as “[the] overall
score DOES NOT accurately reﬂect my opinion of this hotel” (R96). Reviewers usually had a roughly pre-determined
score in their mind to assign to their hotel stay.
Reviewers with a score of 2.5 (n=111) wrote that they had
aimed for the lowest possible score for a hotel as they “liked

The algorithm by Booking.com seems to be biased in the
high direction. (R55)
Reviewers became confused when confronted by a higher
than intended review score. They were “not sure how booking.com came up with the score” (R114), expressing that
the “rating calculated by this site is confusing based on
[their] feedback” (R148). While the uncertainty resulting
from mismatched review scores confused some reviewers,

66

it also prompted some (n=67) to further reﬂect on the way
Booking.com calculated their review score.
Users tried to make inferences about the review ratings,
discovering that “some algorithm they have on this site is
giving them [hotels] a rating better than 0” (R54). They
highlighted the calculated nature of the ratings, stating that
their review score “was automatically calculated by booking.com” (R146) and was not given by themselves directly:
“This score is automatically calculated and even with the
most unhappy face gives it a 2.5” (R160).
To understand how the rating algorithm calculated their
review scores, users attempted to prod the algorithm by entering different subscores for each evaluation criteria — the
inputs of the rating algorithm:

or “Don’t be fooled by the ratings” (R27). As a result, reviewers urged other users to refer to the text of the reviews
rather than their ratings to learn about the reviewers’ true
stay experience:
PLEASE READ THESE COMMENTS - I AM MAKING
IT IN THE INTEREST OF FUTURE GUESTS. The rating as calculated by Booking.com does not do justice to
our experience. (R150)
Prior work has suggested that in designing algorithmic
systems, users’ uncertainty about the algorithms (while challenging) can lead them to “deeper thinking and even more
creative and innovative use of the system” (Eslami et al.
2016). In our study, the users’ confusion about their review
scores triggered such an innovative use of the system —
proding the algorithm to understand its functionality and
changing the usual use of a review to reﬂect it. Reviewers
used their review content to raise awareness among other
users about a rating bias in the system rather than only sharing their hotel stay experience.

I looked at what score your “algorithm” comes up
[with] if I give the lowest grade on all fronts and it still
comes out with a 2.5 instead of zero! So I guess your
range is from 2.5 to 10, instead of 0 to 10. Nice! (R38)
Through these experiments with the algorithm inputs,
some hypothesized that the algorithm not only inﬂates the
lowest review scores to 2.5, but also skews higher scores upwards: Booking.com’s lowest score possible is 2.5, not 0. (So
while it says 5/10, we’re really aiming at a 2.5/10) (R27).
These explanations match our results in RQ1, where we
found that Booking.com biases the businesses ratings higher
in general when compared to other hotel rating platforms.
In “The Relevance of Algorithms,” Gillespie calls such
user practices to reverse-engineer an algorithm “backstage
access” (Gillespie 2012). Although algorithms in sociotechnical systems are usually hidden in black boxes, users sometimes try to make sense of them. They attempt to prod an algorithm by changing its inputs and affect its outputs for their
own beneﬁt. For example, teenagers add product names to
their Facebook stories in the hope of getting more visibility
from the News Feed curation algorithm (boyd 2014).
Our study, however, points to a more complex story: users
might attempt to prod an algorithm and understand how it
works for reasons that are beyond their own beneﬁt. Confronted by a bias in their review score, reviewers tried to
understand how the rating algorithm works. They, however,
did not do this solely for personal knowledge; they aimed to
to make others aware of the bias as well.

Righting a Wrong
This survey calculated its own rating; I would rate it 1.0.
(R40)
Understanding the bias and making other users aware of it
was not the only action reviewers took when confronted by
their biased review score. Over half of the reviewers (n=95)
tried to correct the bias. Believing that their review score
is “very exaggerated” (R60) and “far too kind” (R50) for
their stay experience, many users disclaimed their score: “I
don’t know how it calculated a 2.5 but that’s not my rating!”
(R139). They tried to change their review score by announcing their “true rating” (R71) in their review text; whether
their calculated score was 2.5: “Deﬁnitely not a 2.5 score. 1
would be my true score” (R119), or higher: “My rating, as
added up by Booking.com of 8.8 is more like a 7 in reality”
(R140). Some asked others to consider their corrected score
rather than the one the algorithm calculated: “For some reason the lowest score I can give them on booking is 2.5. But
don’t get me wrong, this is not even a 1 out of ten” (R28).
Users’ attempts to correct the rating bias via their review
text correspond closely with “improvisation theory,” where
an unmet system requirement triggers users to improvise,
making ad hoc adjustments to their system use to achieve
their goal (McGann and Lyytinen 2010). Here, users’ improvisation was a “repair” activity. Past work has studied the
value of repair in technology reuse and the ﬁxing of broken
machines through users’ creative and improvisational work
(Jackson and Kang 2014; Houston et al. 2016). Our ﬁndings
point to a broader story: as users try to repair broken devices,
they might also try to repair a broken algorithm. And in doing so, they exhibit improvisational and innovative work by
changing their review text to reﬂect their real review score.

From Uncertainty to Awareness Raising After probing
how the rating algorithm worked, many reviewers used their
review as an opportunity to share their understanding of the
algorithm with others. Not only did they seek to share their
knowledge about how the algorithm works, they wanted to
warn other users about the existing rating bias on Booking.com, and help them make more informed decisions
when looking for a hotel. Therefore, reviewers began by asking others to “take note that 2.5 is the absolute minimum
you can score a hotel” (R15). They then used their inferences about the algorithm to suggest that other users not only
“ignore the 2.5 score” (R20) but also “ignore the ratings”
(R109) altogether. Telling readers to “be forewarned” (R58)
was a common theme via warnings like “Pay no attention
to the score: the worst is 2.5 thus scores don’t help” (R25)

Manipulating the Algorithm Users’ “repairs” of the biased system did not stop at changing their review texts. A
few reviewers aimed to ﬁx the calculated review score itself.
To do so, they manipulated the evaluation criteria subscores
they had previously assigned to force the algorithm to calculate a ﬁnal review score closer to their desired score:

67

instead taking their whole review to question their lack of
control over their rating:
This review is rigged.[...] I am not commenting as the
survey would not allow me to rate the property. The survey already calculated my survey to 7.5 without providing me the ability to input my rating or data. (R153)
Users develop theories about how an algorithm works, but
they can only act on those theories where they feel control
(Eslami et al. 2016). Once users understand an algorithm,
they build workaround strategies to maintain control over
it (Lustig et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2015). Having a sense of
agency over an algorithmic presentation of their data has led
users to have more engaging and trusting interactions with
an algorithmic system (Eslami et al. 2015). Losing this sense
of agency may result in dissatisfaction or even a breach of
trust with the system; particularly if this lack of control has
been caused due to a bias, as our results demonstrate.

After the auto-calculated review score (it runs from 2.510, NOT 1-10, so a below average shows up as a 5
rating), I altered my ratings on the staff to show what
the overall score should be. (R152).
Although this manipulation might misrepresent a reviewer’s opinion about a speciﬁc criterion, it did not stop
them from changing their subscores. Their desire to match
the overall review score with their stay was stronger than
their desire to match each subscore. Reviewers lowered the
criteria ratings until they were satisﬁed with the ﬁnal score:
I had given the hotel the lowest score to customer service and pretty high scores to most other things as the
hotel indeed looks very nice and it’s clean. But [...]
this hotel stay deserved a 3 not an 8 which the algorithm’ had automatically calculated on the back of my
responses and doesn’t allow me to amend. I amended
other responses accordingly to reach the 3 the hotel deserved. (R38)

Questioning the Algorithm, Asking for Change Once
their trust was broken, some reviewers challenged Booking.com to explain its algorithm:
Your review ratings make no sense. It seems the lower
the client rating the higher you rate yourself. A Complete fraud! You calculate my rating as 7.9 ? My personal opinion is a maximum of 3 out of 10. Please explain. (R83)
These users questioned whether Booking.com’s ratings
were of any use, if they are biased: “What is the point of
offering customers to leave reviews if you just inﬂate them
yourself and clearly are not interested in the feedback?”
(R39). Some users even requested changes to the algorithm,
asking Booking.com to “gather correct information and
post the truth rather than manipulated ratings (R161). They
asked Booking.com to “stop tricking people into” (R122)
low quality hotels by skewing their ratings:
“Booking.com needs to change the way they do their
ratings!” I Want to know how you at booking.com come
up with your scores. Do you even read anything people
say? Maybe two people said anything a little nice about
this place but I think they were being sarcastic....Maybe
people should start rating you guys! (R104)

Prior work showed users might manipulate an algorithm’s
inputs to create workarounds and maintain control over systems such as ride-sharing services (Lee et al. 2015) and social feeds (Eslami et al. 2015; 2016). In our study, however,
users do not create workarounds only for self-concerned reasons, but also to correct a bias to help others.

Trust Breakdown
I will never trust your rating again. (R82)
Algorithms are “stabilizers of trust” (Gillespie 2012): they
are supposed to be objective and free of intentional bias. But
if they are not, how would that affect users’ behavior? Confronted by a biased rating, some reviewers (n=26) argued
that Booking.com “is misleading [the] public” (R9). This
belief resulted in a mistrust of the platform. Users stated that
giving a hotel a score of 2.5 when they rated every evaluation
criteria at its lowest would misguide other readers:
How [are] you calculating the ratings as 2.5 when I
rated every option at the lowest. 2.5 is giving them a
plug for someone to stay there. STAY AWAY (R73)
Mistrust of the platform led users to call it “a con” (R2)
and a “SCAM!!!” (R6), and warn others that “the rating by
booking.com is rigged” (R30). They announced their own
mistrust, but also suggested others “NOT TRUST THE CUSTOMER RATINGS ON THIS SITE” (R152).

Stating a Departure from the Platform A few reviewers
experienced a breach of trust with the whole platform, not
only its rating system. Announcing their dissatisfaction with
the ratings and asking for explanation and change in the algorithm was not enough. These users stated that they would
not use the platform again: I put the lowest rating possible
for this hotel, and booking.com is still giving them a 2.5 rating. I won’t use this website again (R134). Another wrote, “I
don’t know if I’d use this service again. For instance, I rated
everything super sad face except location. Which I rated
sad face and booking.com ‘calculated’ my rating at 2.9”
(R162). While we do not know if these reviewers stopped
using Booking.com, these statements, though extreme, are
indicative of the serious effects a biased algorithm can have
on the interaction of user and system. When a user ﬁnds bias
in a part of a platform, she might judge the whole, perhaps
even leaving it entirely.

Lack of Agency In reviews questioning the algorithm,
users rhetorically asked questions like “Is it possible to create a score lower than 2.5?” (R59) and “Don’t know what
you would have to say to get a 0?” (R119). Many reviewers tried to achieve lower scores than 2.5, but could not:
“I would give a lower rating if I could, but this review
will not allow anything below 2.5” (R128). Their lack of
“control of the overall review score calculator” (R96) made
them “VERY UNHAPPY” (R74). They “don’t like that booking.com [is] taking all [their] lowest score[s] possible and
giving an overall rating of 2.5” (R29). The fact that the algorithm “forces” (R141) a score upon them even led one
reviewer not to leave any comment about their hotel stay,

Limitations

own review score to the whole system. They inferred that the
algorithm might bias all hotel ratings towards higher scores,
suggesting that others ignore the ratings or not trust the entire platform. Users’ shift in focus towards algorithms can
be used to discover bias or other unexpected outcomes of
algorithmic systems, as we discuss below.

While our method of searching for users who mentioned the
rating bias in their review was able to detect many, it did not
detect them all. However, this was not our goal. We aimed to
understand whether there were users who were aware of the
bias and if so, how they behaved around the bias. In addition,
we only analyzed behavior of users who reﬂected the bias in
their review, and not those who became aware of the bias
but did not mention it in their review. As a result, we cannot
comment on the number of users who discovered the bias.
We explored users’ behavior at a speciﬁc time (when users
were writing their reviews); we do not know whether and
how their behavior might change in the future (e.g., in their
next use of the system) as we did not have the means to contact these users. Booking.com user proﬁles are anonymous.
In our study, a fragment of the algorithm’s biased outcome
was visible to the users via the Web site interface. We investigated users’ behavior around this fragment. We look forward to extending this analysis to investigate how users perceive and manage other types of biased algorithms whose
bias might not be discernible by users via the interface.

Watchdog from within: Bringing Bias to the
Surface
In using their reviews to inform others about rating bias on
Booking.com, many reviewers employed an audit practice:
they detected a bias and tried to publicize it. We foresee
many opportunities in designing for this practice as an explicit affordance of platforms wherein bias may unexpectedly emerge, and perhaps even some advantages over other
approaches to discovering such biases. Existing algorithm
audit techniques have usually been used by third-parties
(such as researchers and watchdog organizations) who are
neither system designers nor regular users. Audits by thirdparties are limited by their lack of direct access to the algorithm at hand, but also by their perspective from outside
the actual performance and use of a particular interface in
day-to-day experience, or consistent exposure to the algorithm’s potential biases. An audit by users, however, looks
for bias from the viewpoint of regular use, perhaps increasing the likelihood of detecting bias, and certainly leading
to discovery and correction informed by embedded practice. This practice also uses the platform itself to let other
users know about the bias, which increases the likelihood
that other users will become aware as well.
These beneﬁts call for use of “collective audit” practices
in algorithmic systems. Previous work suggested an audit
technique in which users come together as volunteers to audit an algorithmic system, in collaboration with researchers
(Sandvig et al. 2014). This technique, however, requires
more than a user’s day-to-day usage to detect bias; it requires users to test a system with different inputs and collaborate with researchers. Similar approaches exist on external websites where users of travel websites come together to
understand how an algorithm might work4 . Yet this practice
needs a second platform for users to join together and audit
an algorithm. What if a platform could provide users with
affordances that they could use to detect and report an algorithmic bias via the platform itself, particularly those biases
that the systems designers did not anticipate themselves?
Our study illustrates that users can detect algorithmic bias
during their regular usage of a system. It also shows that
they do want to inform others about it, if the platform allows.
This suggests the potential of “bias-aware design” to aggregate the power of many users and bring algorithm bias to
the surface. By bias-aware design, we mean design in which
users are able to report algorithmic bias if they notice it. At
the simplest level, this can be an interface that allows users
to report a bias (e.g., a bias-report button). Achieving a biasaware design that utilizes the beneﬁts of a collective audit
practice efﬁciently, however, remains for future work.

Discussion
From Bias Awareness to Situated Actions
Users usually have plans when they interact with a system;
in a hotel rating platform, for instance, a user might intend to
compliment excellent hotel staff or to warn others away from
a hotel they disliked. Plans change, however, and are difﬁcult to separate from the actions through which they emerge
(Suchman 1987): seeing a biased score might lead users to
revise their plans. In this study, we built on this theory of
situated actions to understand whether and how users orient their actions towards an algorithm that might bias their
intended review score. In doing so, users shifted their attention to different aspects of their interaction with the system,
depending on what they wished to change.
Focus on Own Experience Some who were unsatisﬁed
with their hotel stay and noticed that their review score did
not accurately reﬂect their experience focused their efforts
on ensuring an accurate representation of their hotel stay
through the comment option, and not on assessing the rating
system itself or informing others about that rating system. To
make others aware of how bad their hotel stay was, for example, they noted that their rating was “way too high” (R43)
and “this hotel’ doesn’t deserve that rating or [their] money”
(R124), but did not comment on where the bias might come
from, or how such bias might impact other ratings in the system. They mainly focused on correcting how platform presented their own stay experience by informing others that
their review score did not reﬂect their hotel stay correctly.
A Shift in Focus: From Own Experience to the System
Others, when encountering a system that did not afford them
an opportunity to realize their plans, turned their attention
from their hotel stay experience to the system. These users,
when confronted by the rating bias, wanted to know how
the algorithm worked and wanted to let others know as well.
In doing so, some generalized the bias they observed in their

What’s Next? (Enough) Transparency and Trust

ent online hotel rating platforms (for example by providing
the data we collected in our cross-platform audit technique).
This comparison might boost users’ understanding of algorithmic systems and their potential biases. Further research,
however, is required to explore such methodologies.

At ﬁrst glance, removing an algorithm’s bias after detecting
it may appear to be the simplest solution. For example, Fandango, a movie rating website, corrected an algorithmic bug
that rounded up to a higher rating rather than to the nearest
half star (Hickey 2015). Flickr resolved its auto-tagging bias
(that labeled Black people with the tag “ape”) by manually
removing those tags and using those mistakes to improve
their algorithm (Hern 2015). These solutions, however, are
not always practical. What if an algorithm’s bias comes from
an inherent bias in input data? What if the bias did not result
from a simple software bug but rather from a complex interaction between thousands of parameters in an algorithm?
These challenges call for alternative solutions to confront
algorithmic bias. One solution is adding transparency to
communicate algorithmic process in the interface. Algorithmic transparency via design can lead users to a more intelligent and adaptive use of a system (Khovanskaya, Bezaitis,
and Sengers 2016). We, however, note that making a system
completely transparent is usually neither possible nor desired. Algorithms are complex, dynamic, and unpredictable.
Even if a designer can gain enough technical literacy to analyze an algorithm, it is often impossible to recreate the complicated and embedded internal processes of an algorithm
via design. What we advocate is the study of “actionable
transparency” whereby designers with knowledge of their
system communicate pivotal algorithmic process cues in the
interface — in some cases with features that allow for poking and prodding. Comparison also serves as a powerful
means for revealing elements of algorithmic process (Eslami
et al. 2015). Such level of transparency can be particularly
helpful if an algorithmic system might bias users’ experiences. Kulshrestha et al., for example, proposed an alternative design for Twitter search in which users are exposed to
Twitter’s potential political bias (Kulshrestha et al. 2017).
Such designs might beneﬁt both users and the systems
they use. For users, increased transparency in some cases
can make them aware of existing biases in an algorithmic
system, showing that algorithms are not always free of bias.
This awareness can help them to adjust their behavior. Making users aware of bias can beneﬁt a system as well, by
building user trust in the system. For instance, analyzing the
effects of transparency on an algorithmic peer assessment
interface showed that a more transparent grading algorithm
increased users’ trust in the system when their expectations
were violated by receiving a lower than expected grade. To
maintain this trust, however, we need balanced transparency;
too much may also affect trust (Kizilcec 2016).
On Booking.com, a part of users’ distrust comes from
the inconsistency between what the interface claims (1) and
what the algorithm calculates (2.5) as the lowest review
score. Even if Booking.com’s business policy prevents modifying its lowest score to 1, making this policy transparent
(e.g. by highlighting the 2.5 limit for low scores in the interface) may increase user trust in the system .
Another option for increasing transparency is to provide
opportunities for comparison between different algorithms’
outputs. For example, consider a design in which a user is
able to observe and compare a hotel’s rating across differ-

Conclusion
We detected and quantiﬁed a rating algorithm’s bias using a
cross-platform audit technique. We found that users oriented
towards and adapted their behavior around this bias: they
tried to look into the algorithm’s black box, correct the bias,
and demonstrate a trust breakdown with the platform. These
ﬁndings bring many opportunities and challenges. Designers of algorithmic systems can use users’ collective power in
auditing algorithms to shed light on potential existing algorithmic biases. Resolving these biases, however, is not easy.
We argue that adding (enough) transparency and “actionable
transparency” to algorithmic systems can rebuild users’ trust
in a system. As more algorithmic processes curate online
content, they are more prone to bias user experiences. This
work is a ﬁrst step towards understanding the effects of such
biases on user behavior. We hope our ﬁndings inspire future
designs to better accommodate bias awareness among users.
