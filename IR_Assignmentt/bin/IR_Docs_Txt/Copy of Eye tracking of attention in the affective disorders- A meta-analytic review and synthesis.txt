A large body of research has demonstrated that affective disorders are characterized by attentional biases for
emotional stimuli. However, this research relies heavily on manual reaction time (RT) measures that cannot
fully delineate the time course and components of attentional bias. Eye tracking technology, which allows
relatively direct and continuous measurement of overt visual attention, may provide an important supplement
to RT measures. This article reviews eye tracking research on anxiety and depression, evaluating the experimental paradigms and eye movement indicators used to study attentional biases. Also included is a meta-analysis of
extant eye tracking research (33 experiments; N =1579) on both anxiety and depression. Relative to controls,
anxious individuals showed increased vigilance for threat during free viewing and visual search, and showed difﬁculty disengaging from threat in visual search tasks, but not during free viewing. In contrast, depressed individuals were not characterized by vigilance for threat during free viewing, but were characterized by reduced
orienting to positive stimuli, as well as reduced maintenance of gaze on positive stimuli and increased maintenance of gaze on dysphoric stimuli. Implications of these ﬁndings for theoretical accounts of attentional bias in
anxiety and depression are discussed, and avenues for future research using eye-tracking technology are
outlined.

1. Introduction
Dating back to the spread of psychology's “cognitive revolution”
to psychotherapy, attentional biases for emotional stimuli have been
a key mechanism in theoretical accounts of affective disorders
(e.g., Beck, 1976; Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Matthews, 1988). Several
experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology have been adapted
to test these theories, resulting in a large literature documenting an
attentional bias for threat in anxiety disorders (Bar-Haim, Lamy,
Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2007), and a
smaller literature suggesting an attentional bias for dysphoric stimuli
and possible neglect of positive stimuli in depression (Peckham,
McHugh, & Otto, 2010). More recently, cognitive paradigms originally
used to demonstrate information-processing biases have been further
modiﬁed to treat these biases, and some studies have found that attenuating bias toward threatening stimuli leads to lasting symptom relief in
anxious individuals (see Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). There is also evidence
that training attention away from dysphoric stimuli may alleviate
depression (Wells & Beevers, 2010). Thus, in addition to being pervasive
in affective disorders, abnormal processing of emotional stimuli appears
to be implicated in the etiology and maintenance of some of these
disorders, in line with early cognitive accounts (Beck, 1976).
Although there is substantial evidence that anxiety and depression
are characterized by attentional biases, the nature of these biases is
not completely understood. In research on anxiety disorders, it is
still unclear to what extent increased processing of threat reﬂects
facilitated orienting toward threat versus difﬁculty disengaging attention from threat (Weierich, Treat, & Hollingworth, 2008). A smaller
number of studies utilizing longer stimulus exposures raise questions
about whether anxiety-related biases are always “for” or “toward”
threat; at later processing stages, rapid disengagement or sustained
attention away from threat have been observed in anxious individuals
(e.g., Koster, Verschuere, Crombez, & Van Damme, 2005). In research
on depression, it has been hypothesized that an attentional bias for dysphoric stimuli operates at later, more voluntary stages of processing
than the attentional bias for threat in anxiety (Mogg & Bradley, 2005);

however, there is a paucity of research examining the time course of
attentional bias in depression (Peckham et al., 2010), and the components involved in the biases related to dysphoric and positive stimuli
remain unclear. As noted in recent reviews, delineating the time course
and components of attentional bias is not only essential to advancing
theoretical models (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Cisler, Bacon, & Williams,
2009), it is also crucial for understanding and improving attention modiﬁcation procedures (Cisler & Koster, 2010). If attention modiﬁcation
procedures indeed work by re-training attention in an antagonistic
manner, such that biases are “undone” or “reversed,” then clarifying
the time course and components of biases is necessary for specifying
treatment targets.
As noted in recent reviews (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Weierich et al.,
2008), further insight into the time course and components of attentional bias may require a broader set of tools for measuring attention.
The extensive literature on attentional biases for emotional stimuli in
affective disorders is composed mostly of studies using reaction time
(RT) measures of attention (emotional Stroop task; Williams, Mathews,
& MacLeod, 1996; modiﬁed dot probe; MacLeod, Mathews, & Tata,
1986; emotional spatial cueing task; Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton,
2001; see Weierich et al., 2008 for a review). These cost-effective measures have been critical in advancing the study of attentional biases for
threat. Further, the application of RT measures to studying attentional
biases has been marked by steady innovation, as seen in the reﬁnement
of classic paradigms, as well as the integration of novel tasks from cognitive science (Weierich et al., 2008). However, some limitations of RT
measures are inherent to using key presses as indices of attention, and
thus cannot be surpassed without appealing to additional methodologies. For example, the distal relation between key presses and attention
leaves RT measures vulnerable to the confounding effect of emotional information on mediating processes, such as response execution. Likewise,
the “snapshot” nature of RT measures (i.e., their restriction to a single time
point within a trial) necessarily imposes limits on the effectiveness and
efﬁciency with which dynamic attentional processes can be described.
To see beyond the snapshots provided by RT measures of attention, some researchers have turned to eye tracking technology. Eye

tracking systems, which sample gaze direction at rates between 60
and 2000 Hz, provide a continuous measure of attentional selection
performed via eye movements (EMs; “overt attention”). In between
EMs, further selection can be accomplished with “covert” attention,
shifts in acuity that occur without reorienting gaze. However, in naturalistic viewing, EMs are the primary means of attentional selection,
with covert attention largely relegated to guiding EMs (Findlay &
Gilchrist, 2003; Hayhoe & Ballard, 2005). Yet due to the dominance
of the passive vision paradigm, EMs have been somewhat disregarded
in basic research on visual attention (Pashler, 1998), and consequently,
in translational research on attentional biases for emotional stimuli
(e.g., Fox et al., 2001). Indeed, the term visual attention has come to
denote covert as opposed to overt attention, reﬂecting the tendency
to treat EMs as peripheral, indirect events in visual selection (Findlay
& Gilchrist, 2003). Likewise, in the literature on attentional biases in
affective disorders, more concerns have been raised regarding how
well EMs index covert attention, rather than how well covert attention
generalizes to actual viewing behavior. When considering some of the
hypothesized proximal effects of attentional bias, such as elevated
state anxiety from increased detection of threat (Mogg & Bradley,
1998), or task interference from difﬁculty disengaging attention from
negative stimuli (Cisler & Koster, 2010), it seems very unlikely that
either could result from a covert visual bias alone. Given the importance
of EMs in selecting stimuli and guiding action in everyday life (Hayhoe
& Ballard, 2005), overt attention may be a necessary mediator of the
effects of covert visual biases in anxiety and depression.
In light of eye tracking's potential value for research on attentional
biases in anxiety and depression, an integrative methodological and
empirical review may guide future research along these lines. Although
this growing literature was noted in a narrative review of clinical eye
tracking research (Toh, Rossell, & Castle, 2011), a deeper, more rigorous
analysis is needed. The present article reviews the application of eye
tracking methodology in the study of attentional biases for threat in
anxiety and depression, focusing on the EM indicators and experimental paradigms used to test theoretical accounts of attentional bias, as
well as the added value of eye tracking relative to RT measures of attention. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to assess
the implications of extant eye tracking research for these theories, and
to guide future research in this promising area of investigation.
2. Theoretical accounts of attentional bias in affective disorders
To understand the application of eye tracking to research on affective disorders, it is necessary to consider the theoretical accounts of
attentional bias that guide this research. In this section, we review
models of attentional bias in anxiety and depression, and the theoretical issues most amenable to eye tracking methodology.
2.1. Anxiety
Although there is considerable debate over the speciﬁcity of stimuli required to elicit biases (e.g., Becker, Rinck, Margraf, & Roth, 2001),
as well as the stages at which evaluative mechanisms inﬂuence attention (e.g., Bar-Haim et al., 2007), the attentional components that
underlie attentional biases have been the most contested theoretical
issue, with starkly contrasting accounts of increased attention towards
threat. These competing accounts have been termed the ‘vigilance’
and ‘maintenance’ hypotheses (Weierich et al., 2008), and are best
understood in the context of Posner's model (e.g., Posner & Peterson,
1990) of the components of spatial visual attention. In Posner's model,
a ‘shift’ mechanism orients attention from one location to another,
while distinct ‘engage’ and ‘disengage’ mechanisms hold and release
attention between shifts.
The vigilance hypothesis posits that individuals with anxiety disorders detect threat more easily, and thus orient (i.e. shift) attention
towards threat more often. In line with this hypothesis, both dichotic

listening (Foa & McNally, 1986) and signal detection studies (Wiens,
Peira, Golkar, & Öhman, 2008) have found that individuals with
anxiety disorders have lower detection thresholds for threatening
stimuli, and research on spatial attention suggests that these decreased
thresholds lead to increased orienting towards threat (e.g., Mogg &
Bradley, 2002). A crucial feature of the vigilance hypothesis is its
emphasis on stimulus-driven, ‘exogenous’ shifts of attention. An
abundance of behavioral and neuropsychological research suggests
a fundamental distinction between a stimulus-driven system and a
goal-directed system in the control of attention (Corbetta & Shulman,
2002; Posner & Peterson, 1990). The stimulus-driven system responds
to unattended, motivationally-relevant events, enabling their detection
through automatic shifts in attention (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002).
Accounts of facilitated detection of threat (e.g., LeDoux, 2000;
Vuilleumier, 2005) have focused on the role of the amygdala, which
receives early sensory input, and returns projections to sensory processing areas. Through this pattern of connectivity, the amygdala can
detect motivationally-relevant stimuli early in visual processing and
bias competition at later stages of processing, such that threatening
stimuli are more likely to capture attention or enter working memory
(Sander, Grafman, & Zalla, 2003).
Whereas the vigilance hypothesis has been articulated mostly in
relation to the stimulus-driven system, the maintenance hypothesis
places more emphasis on the goal-directed system of attention. In
contrast to the stimulus-driven system, the goal-directed system
selects and maintains focus on stimuli according to ongoing plans,
resulting in voluntary, ‘endogenous’ shifts of attention as well as the
inhibition of exogenous shifts of attention to distracting stimuli.
Whereas the vigilance hypothesis predicts facilitation of exogenous
shifts of attention toward threat, the maintenance hypothesis predicts impairment of endogenous shifts of attention away from threat,
due to difﬁculty disengaging attention from threat (Fox et al., 2001).
According to this latter account, biases emerge after threat detection,
as threatening stimuli hold attention longer in anxious individuals.
Attentional control theory (ACT; Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, &
Calvo, 2007) provides a useful context for understanding the underlying mechanisms of increased maintenance of attention on threat. ACT
speciﬁes three central executive functions involved in endogenous attention control: inhibition (i.e., inhibiting task-irrelevant processing
or responding), shifting (i.e., changing mental sets), and updating
(i.e., refreshing and monitoring the contents of working memory
(Eysenck et al., 2007). Difﬁculty disengaging attention from threat
in anxiety would appear to relate to the inhibition function of the
central executive, as the bias involves difﬁculty inhibiting the initial
processing of threat. Although this imbalance in the attentional control systems of anxious individuals could primarily reﬂect hyperactivity of the exogenous system in response to threat, ACT holds that
general deﬁcits in the endogenous system also play a role. This
claim is supported by several studies documenting attentional control
deﬁcits related to non-threatening stimuli in anxiety (e.g., Ansari
& Derakshan, 2011a; Bishop, 2009). Indeed, Derryberry and Reed
(2002) found that difﬁculty disengaging attention from threat in anxiety was contingent on a more generalized deﬁcit in endogenous
attentional control.
The vigilance and maintenance hypotheses have somewhat different implications for the possible role of attentional biases in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders (Cisler & Koster, 2010). The
vigilance hypothesis suggests that attentional biases may increase
state anxiety by causing increased awareness of threats, and over
time, may increase estimates of vulnerability to threat. Alternatively,
the maintenance hypothesis suggests that attentional biases may
increase state anxiety by maintaining cognitive resources on threat
(Fox et al., 2001), and may impair daily functioning by increasing
the amount of distraction caused by threatening objects or thoughts.
As Weierich et al. (2008) note, the vigilance and maintenance
hypotheses need not be mutually exclusive. Both facilitated detection

T. Armstrong, B.O. Olatunji / Clinical Psychology Review 32 (2012) 704–723

of threat and difﬁculty disengaging from threat may characterize anxiety disorders and contribute to their etiology and maintenance
(Cisler & Koster, 2010).
Although anxious individuals may initially allocate more attention to
threat compared to controls, some studies suggest that this pattern may
reverse with extended viewing, a phenomenon known as ‘attentional
avoidance.’ In addition to operating on a later and more prolonged
time scale, attentional avoidance is believed to be voluntary and strategic, whereas vigilance and maintenance biases are considered involuntary and somewhat automatic (Cisler & Koster, 2010). Attentional
avoidance is believed to have a functional role similar to behavioral
avoidance, in that it prevents reappraisal of threatening stimuli and
thereby maintains harm associations (Mogg, Mathews, & Weinman,
1987). For example, by behaviorally avoiding a shed with spiders, a
spider phobic is deprived of the opportunity to learn that encountering
a spider does not predict a feared outcome (e.g., a venomous bite). If
the individual were to enter the shed, but then avoid looking at the
regions likely to contain spiders, the outcome for learning and reappraisal
could be equivalent to avoiding the situation in the ﬁrst place.
2.2. Depression
Early theoretical accounts (e.g., Beck, 1976) of attentional bias in
depression posit a ‘mood-congruent bias,’ in which negative affect
causes increased attention to negative stimuli. However, many
researchers have had difﬁculty demonstrating an attentional bias in
depression (see Mogg & Bradley, 2005). This difﬁculty has led some
(e.g., MacLeod et al., 1986) to suggest that an attentional bias may
be unique to anxiety, whereas a memory bias may be unique to
depression (Peckham et al., 2010). However, the experimental
parameters typically used to study attentional bias have been largely
derived from research on anxiety and may not be ideal for research
on depression. Mogg and Bradley (2005) note that attentional bias
in depression has been most often observed for dysphoric stimuli
at later, more voluntary stages of stimulus processing. Some of the
studies failing to observe attentional bias in depression had parameters more typical of research on anxiety disorders, as they employed
threatening rather than dysphoric negative stimuli (e.g., MacLeod
et al., 1986), or presented stimuli for brief rather than extended durations (e.g., Mogg, Bradley, Williams, & Mathews, 1993).
This pattern of results may suggest that dysphoric stimuli do not
exogenously capture attention in depression in a manner resembling
the facilitated detection of threat in anxiety (Mogg & Bradley, 2005).
Given that exogenous attentional capture is reserved for stimuli that
tend to be novel or urgent (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002), stimuli relevant to depression (e.g., a reminder of past loss or of one's symptoms
of depression) would not be expected to trigger exogenous orienting.
Attentional bias in depression may instead be a product of a ruminative cognitive style, in which depressed individuals dwell on dysphoric, self-relevant content in an attempt to work through symptoms or
learn from failures (Koster, De Lissnyder, Derakshan, & De Raedt,
2011; Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008). Accordingly,
attentional bias in depression may involve the goal-directed attentional system, as depressed individuals voluntarily maintain attention
on dysphoric content as they engage in elaborative processing.
Although the maintenance bias for dysphoric content in depression
may begin voluntarily, depressed individuals may eventually attempt
to disengage attention from dysphoric content, yet fail to endogenously shift attention elsewhere, in a manner comparable to the
maintenance bias predicted in anxiety (Koster et al., 2011). Indeed,
attentional control deﬁcits have been observed in depression (see
Koster et al., 2011), particularly in individuals high in rumination
(De Lissnyder, Derakshan, De Raedt, & Koster, 2011) and in the presence of emotional stimuli (Derakshan, Salt, & Koster, 2009). A tendency
to dwell on dysphoric stimuli could play a role in the etiology and maintenance of depression: in the short term, dwelling on dysphoric stimuli

707

could increase negative affect (Peckham et al., 2010); in the long term,
this attentional style could lead to distorted beliefs and assumptions
about the world.
The mood-congruent attentional bias posited by cognitive theories of depression (e.g., Beck, 1976) may also extend to deﬁcits in
positive affect. A small number of studies have observed reduced
attention towards positive stimuli in depressed individuals relative
to controls (see Peckham et al., 2010). This group difference may
reﬂect the lack of a normative positivity bias in depression (McCabe
and Gotlib, 1995), although the underlying attentional components
and time course of this bias are unclear. An anhedonic bias in depression could involve insensitivity to reward in the stimulus-driven system, such that rewarding stimuli fail to initially capture attention.
Alternatively, insensitivity to reward in depression may have greater
implications for the goal-directed attentional system, as depressed individuals lack the motivation to sustain attention on positive stimuli.
Reduced attention to positive stimuli could contribute to deﬁcits in
positive affect and over time could distort assumptions and beliefs
about the world. Given that deﬁcits in positive affect are speciﬁc to
depression (Clark & Watson, 1991), they are not predicted in anxiety
disorders. However, some studies have found increased attention to
positive stimuli in anxiety (e.g., Fox et al., 2001, exp. 3; Fox et al.,
2002, exp. 1). The “emotionality hypothesis” (see Calvo & Avero,
2005) posits that stimulus-driven system in anxious individuals is
hypersensitive to all motivationally-relevant events, leading to biases
for positive stimuli in addition to negative stimuli.
3. Advancing theoretical accounts of attentional bias
with eye tracking
Despite decades of research, key issues in theoretical accounts of
attentional bias in affective disorders remain unresolved, such as
the components of attentional bias in anxiety, and the nature of
attentional bias in depression. These issues largely hinge on the
empirical delineation of the time course and components of attentional bias in anxiety and depression, which remains a work in progress. RT measures, the main tool for studying attentional biases,
have provided important insight into the nature of attentional bias.
However, certain limitations of these measures, including the distal
relation between key presses and attention and the “snapshot” nature
of RT measures, are inherent and cannot be overcome without incorporating other means of measuring attention.
Eye tracking may provide a valuable complement to RT measures,
as the methodology is largely unhindered by the inherent limitations
of RT measures. Importantly, EMs have a more proximal relation to
attention than manual key presses. While eye tracking can only
directly measure overt attention, the relation between EMs and
covert attention is much closer than that of manual responses and
covert attention. As a result, EMs are less susceptible to confounding
processes. Critically, saccadic EMs appear to escape the general
response slowing or “freezing” (McNaughton & Corr, 2004) caused by
threatening stimuli, which may confound manual RT measures, particularly the emotional Stroop (see Algom, Chajut, & Lev, 2004) and spatial
cueing task (see Mogg, Holmes, Garner, & Bradley, 2008). For example,
Nummenmaa, Hyöna, and Calvo (2006) presented pairs of images
(negative–neutral, pleasant–neutral, neutral–neutral) diagonally, in
opposite quadrants of the screen, and found that initial saccade latencies did not differ according to the type of image pair, regardless of
whether the initial saccade targeted one of the images or empty space
on the screen. Thus, the mere presence of threat does not appear to
increase EM latencies in the same manner in which it increases RT
latencies.
In addition to providing a relatively proximal measure of attention,
EMs can be recorded more or less continuously, with sampling rates
ranging from 16.67 ms (60 Hz) to less than 1 ms (e.g., 2000 Hz).
Fig. 1a provides a scan path from an eye tracking study (Armstrong,

Olatunji, Sarawgi, & Simmons, 2010) that illustrates the continuity of
eye tracking data. By allowing virtually continuous recording of attention, eye tracking provides a remarkable increase in the efﬁciency of
measuring attention. Whereas RT measures require multiple conditions
to parse components of attention, eye tracking allows precise observation of multiple components within a single trial (Fig. 1a), and also provides multiple parameters of each component. For example, both the
latency and location of an initial ﬁxation can be recorded, providing
both a temporal and a spatial parameter of orienting. In contrast, the
emotional spatial cueing task can only provide a measure of the speed
of orienting (Fox et al., 2001), whereas the modiﬁed dot probe mainly
provides an indicator of the direction of orienting. 1 As depicted in
Fig. 1a, the initial orienting of overt attention to a stimulus can be distinguished easily from subsequent dwell time, as orienting is reﬂected in
1
Although few studies have examined the concordance between RT and EM measures of attentional bias in the affective disorders, two studies (Bradley et al., 2000;
Mogg et al., 2007) have found that an attentional bias score (RT) for emotional stimuli
in the modiﬁed dot probe task is correlated with directional orienting bias when EMs
are recorded in the 500 ms version of this task.

saccade sequences (where one looks), whereas dwell time is reﬂected
in ﬁxation durations (how long one looks). Thus, the continuous nature
of eye tracking provides an important advance in characterizing the
time course and components of attentional bias.
3.1. Using EMs as indicators of attentional bias
The body of published eye tracking studies on affective disorders
varies considerably in terms of the experimental parameters and
operational deﬁnitions of attentional bias employed. Some of the
methodological variance can be accounted for by the presence of
two distinct types of task: free viewing tasks and visual search
tasks. In free viewing tasks, which constitute the majority of extant
research, attentional biases are not measured in relation to performance on a task, such as making a saccade to a cued location, or
searching for a target. In these studies, the only restriction on gaze
behavior occurs prior to the onset of a trial, as participants are
asked to focus on a central ﬁxation point to ensure that stimuli are
presented at equal retinal eccentricity. Participants then examine

T. Armstrong, B.O. Olatunji / Clinical Psychology Review 32 (2012) 704–723

arrays of stimuli (e.g., faces, Garner, Mogg, & Bradley, 2006; objects,
Rinck & Becker, 2006; words, Felmingham, Rennie, Manor, & Bryant,
2011) for periods ranging from 1 to 60 s. Visual search tasks, in
contrast, require participants to search an array of stimuli in order
to determine as quickly and accurately as possible if a criterion is
met, usually whether or not a stimulus is present. Presence (or absence)
is indicated by a speeded key press, which provides an additional source
of data that can be integrated with EMs (Derakshan & Koster, 2010).
Visual search tasks also differ from free viewing tasks in that they
require more items in an array to prevent a ﬂoor effect. Whereas arrays
in free viewing tasks involve 2 to 4 stimuli, arrays in visual search tasks
typically involve between 8 and 16 stimuli in the EM literature on anxiety disorders. Whereas anxiety has been examined with both free
viewing and visual search eye tracking paradigms, depression has
only been investigated in free viewing eye tracking tasks.
3.2. Operational deﬁnitions of vigilance and maintenance of attention in
studies of anxiety
3.2.1. Free viewing tasks
In free viewing studies of anxiety (Fig. 1a), operational deﬁnitions of
vigilance have focused on the initial orienting of gaze at stimulus onset.
Most studies have looked at the direction of orienting, analyzing how
frequently threatening images capture initial ﬁxations. Although the
speed of orienting has been commonly reported in basic research on
EMs and attention (saccade latency: Bannerman, Milders, & Sahraie,
2009; saccade latency and velocity: Nummenmaa et al., 2006) this parameter of orienting has rarely been reported in studies of anxiety. In
one of the few studies reporting both variables, Mogg, Millar, and
Bradley (2000) found that the direction and speed of orienting were
moderately correlated, suggesting that these parameters may reﬂect
the same underlying inﬂuence of emotion on saccade programming.
Overt orienting in free viewing tasks appears to reﬂect exogenous
cueing of attention. Nummenmaa et al. (2006) found that when participants (from an unselected sample) were instructed to look at a neutral
image paired with an emotional image (exp. 2), they showed an
orienting bias towards emotional images similar to that exhibited
when viewing the images freely (exp. 1), suggesting that orienting
gaze to motivationally-relevant stimuli is largely involuntary in this
viewing context.
Whereas the latency and location of initial ﬁxation are used to test
the vigilance hypothesis, the duration of initial ﬁxation is frequently
used to test the maintenance hypothesis in anxiety (e.g., Garner
et al., 2006). Typically, studies sum the durations of ﬁxations made on
the initial viewing of a stimulus (e.g., Garner et al., 2006). Nummenmaa
et al. (2006) found that initial maintenance of gaze on emotional stimuli
likely involves both endogenous and exogenous effects: in an unselected
sample, instructions not to look at emotional images (i.e., look at the
accompanying neutral image) had more effect on initial maintenance of
gaze compared to initial orienting of gaze; however, these instructions
were only partially effective, and had a greater effect on a total maintenance of gaze variable that included later stages of processing. Thus, the
exogenous effect of emotional stimuli on attention appears to persist
beyond initial orienting into the initial maintenance of gaze, where it
becomes increasingly subject to the attenuating effects of endogenous
attentional control.
Some studies have used time intervals as the sole basis for deﬁning components of attention bias (e.g., Buckner, Maner, & Schmidt,
2010), assuming that ﬁxation duration in an early window reﬂects
facilitated detection of threat, whereas ﬁxation duration in a subsequent window reﬂects initial maintenance of attention on threat.
Rinck and Becker (2006) describe measures such as the latency,
direction, and duration of initial ﬁxations as ‘event-related,’ because
these variables reference speciﬁc EM events. In contrast, they describe
measures of ﬁxation duration within time windows as ‘epoch-related,’
because these variables extract ﬁxation duration data from speciﬁc

709

gaze events, and re-reference the data to time windows (i.e., epochs)
in which ﬁxations occur. Epoch-related analysis has been the primary
means of investigating attentional avoidance. Change in ﬁxation duration as a function of time has been assessed on scales ranging from 3
to 60 s. Although attentional avoidance has been conceptualized as a
voluntary emotion regulation strategy that emerges later in time
(Cisler & Koster, 2010), it has been measured with event-related variables, as well: briefer initial ﬁxation on threat (Garner et al., 2006;
Rinck & Becker, 2006), as well as orienting away from threat (Garner
et al., 2006), have been construed as indicators of avoidance.
3.2.2. Visual search tasks
In visual search tasks, the vigilance and maintenance hypotheses
are tested in separate visual search conditions. To assess facilitated
detection of threat, a threatening stimulus is presented as the target
in an array of non-threatening distracters (Fig. 1b). Latency to ﬁxating
the target (often used in conjunction with manual response latency)
has been used to provide an overall indicator of facilitated detection
of threat (Rinck, Reinecke, Ellwart, Heuer, & Becker, 2005). To further
clarify the nature of facilitated detection, the sequence of ﬁxations
prior to target detection has been examined. It was previously
believed that threatening stimuli could ‘pop-out’ of a search array
and capture attention, particularly in anxious individuals, but ﬁndings
of this effect (Öhman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001) have been called into
question (see Vuilleumier, 2005). When multiple EMs are required
to locate a threatening target, facilitated detection can occur in at
least two ways. First, a threatening target could be located faster
because fewer ﬁxations are required to reach the target. This may
reﬂect exogenous orienting toward a threat target once gaze is directed
to a nearby distracter, bringing the threatening stimulus within a range
of eccentricity from which it can attract attention. Alternatively, a
threatening target could be located faster due to reduced dwell time
on non-threatening distracters (Becker, 2009).
Whereas facilitated detection of threat is assessed with a threatening target in an array of neutral distracters, difﬁculty disengaging
attention from threat is assessed with a neutral target in an array
with threatening distracters (Fig. 1c). In some studies (Rinck et al.,
2005, exp. 1), all of the distracters are threatening, while in others
(Miltner, Krieschel, Hecht, Trippe, & Weiss, 2004; Rinck et al., 2005,
exp. 2), only a single distracter is threatening, while the remainder
are non-threatening. The former design, in which all distracters are
threatening, ensures that on most trials, a threatening distracter will
be ﬁxated prior to the neutral target. However, when just a single
threatening distracter is included in the search array (e.g., Rinck et
al., 2005), one can examine whether this distracter delays visual
search because it is located more often than other non-threatening
distracters (facilitated detection), or because it holds attention longer
when it is attended (difﬁculty disengaging attention).
3.3. EM indicators of attentional bias in depression
Eye tracking research on attentional bias in depression has mainly
employed the free viewing tasks used in anxiety disorders research,
but with longer stimulus presentations that allow insight into the
elaborative processing of stimuli. Although the vigilance hypothesis
has been less prominent in theoretical accounts of depression, many
of these studies have reported the same indicator of vigilance found
in studies of anxiety (direction of orienting). In examining the maintenance of attention in depression, studies have placed less emphasis
on the initial maintenance of attention, focusing instead on maintenance of attention over the entire trial (e.g., total ﬁxation duration).
Fixation time over extended viewing appears to reﬂect mostly topdown, endogenous control of attention. Whereas emotional stimuli
can undermine endogenous control in the initial maintenance of
gaze, such stimulus-driven effects appear to wane quickly in the
later maintenance of gaze (Nummenmaa et al., 2006).

4. Meta-analysis of eye tracking research on attentional biases
Given the potential of eye tracking to address enduring questions
in research on attentional biases, a meta-analysis was conducted on
the extant literature. The meta-analysis had two primary aims. The
ﬁrst aim was to examine the components of overt attentional bias
for threat in anxiety, and to summarize the theoretical implications
of these ﬁndings. The vigilance hypothesis was tested by examining
initial orienting towards threat in free viewing tasks and facilitated
detection of threat in visual search tasks. Similarly, the maintenance
hypothesis was assessed by examining initial maintenance of gaze
on threat in free viewing tasks and distraction by threat in visual
search tasks. By examining initial maintenance of gaze, the present
meta-analysis was also able to test for possible attentional avoidance,
as this indicator measures a window of stimulus processing in which
avoidance has been observed in some RT studies (e.g., Mogg, Bradley,
Miles, & Dixon, 2004). In exploring the components of attentional bias
for threat in anxiety, several population and procedure-related moderators were considered (Bar-Haim et al., 2007).
The second aim was to examine attentional biases for emotional
stimuli in depression and to contrast these effects with those observed
in anxiety, when possible. Initial orienting towards threatening and
positive stimuli was examined in both anxiety and depression in
order to determine if vigilance for threat was speciﬁc to anxiety and if
reduced sensitivity to positive stimuli was speciﬁc to depression. In
studies of depression, it was also possible to examine orienting towards
dysphoric stimuli, as well as biases in extended viewing (10–30 s
trials). The hypothesis that depressed individuals show increased elaborative processing of negative stimuli (e.g., Siegle, Granholm, Ingram, &
Matt, 2001) was tested, and the speciﬁcity of this bias to dysphoric stimuli was assessed by examining elaborative processing of threatening
stimuli, as well. Lastly, the hypothesis that depressed individuals
show reduced elaborative processing of positive stimuli (e.g., Gotlib &
McCann, 1984) was tested. Although these latter biases could not be
examined in anxiety, these analyses may have important implications
for theories of attentional bias in depression.
5. Methods
5.1. Literature base
PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched for relevant studies
using the key words anxiety, phobia, fear, dysphoria, or depression,
intersected with eye, tracking, eye-tracking, EMs, gaze, or ﬁxation. The
authors of studies revealed by this search were then entered as search
terms into the same databases, in order to uncover additional eye tracking studies. In addition, the references of eye tracking studies revealed
by these methods were consulted, as were the references of review
papers on attentional bias in anxiety or depressive disorders (Bar-Haim
et al., 2007; Cisler & Koster, 2010; Mogg & Bradley, 2005; Weierich
et al., 2008).
There were three primary criteria for inclusion of studies in the
review, in order to ensure commensurability: 1) studies had to utilize
eye tracking, either with video-based infrared systems or electrooculography; 2) attentional biases had to be studied in the context
of anxiety or depression in adults; and 3) studies had to present emotional and neutral stimuli simultaneously, in regular arrays, such that
these stimuli could compete for attention.
5.2. Coding system and coding decisions
Studies were coded in terms of the following population-related
variables: 1) sample size (ns) for high and low symptom group;
2) gender composition (% female) for high and low symptom group
and gender difference between groups (high minus low); 3) class of
disorder (anxiety versus depression); 4) type of high symptom

group (clinical versus analogue); 5) within studies of anxiety, type
of anxiety disorder was also coded. For analogue studies, the most relevant anxiety disorder was coded (e.g. studies of contamination fear
were coded as OCD; studies of trait anxiety were coded as GAD).
Studies were coded in terms of the following procedure-related variables: 1) type of task (free viewing vs. visual search); 2) type of threat
stimulus (face versus picture), where picture refers to images of
scenes or objects; 3) array size; 4) for free viewing tasks, the retinal
eccentricity at which the stimuli were presented, measured from
the central ﬁxation point to the centers of stimuli, was also coded;
5) for free viewing tasks, the type of variable (event versus epoch)
was coded for both indicators of initial orienting and initial maintenance of attention.
For studies that employed more than one category of threat stimulus, variables related to the most potent (e.g., 100% intensity threat
faces; Mogg, Garner, & Bradley, 2007) or the most symptom-relevant
threat stimulus (e.g., combat-related threat for PTSD; Kimble, Fleming,
Bandy, Kim, & Zambetti, 2010) were selected; if categories of threat
stimuli were equally relevant (e.g., neutral face paired with object or
angry face paired with neutral face for SAD; Garner et al., 2006), the
conditions were averaged together to avoid inﬂating effect size estimates (see Mitte, 2008). Similar procedures have been used in other
reviews of attentional bias for threat in anxiety disorders (e.g., Bar-Haim
et al., 2007). Lastly, for visual search tasks, some studies (e.g., Derakshan
& Koster, 2010) placed threatening stimuli among both neutral and pleasant stimuli. To ensure commensurability with other visual search studies,
and to maintain some commensurability with free viewing tasks, variables were selected from conditions with threatening and neutral stimuli.
5.3. Operational deﬁnition of vigilance and maintenance
5.3.1. Free viewing tasks
For free viewing tasks, the vigilance hypothesis was tested by examining the direction in which gaze was initially oriented (i.e., towards or
away from threat). For event-related analyses of vigilance (k = 17), variables indicating how frequently threatening stimuli captured initial ﬁxations were collected. For epoch-related analyses of vigilance (k = 3),
variables indicating total ﬁxation time on threatening stimuli within
the ﬁrst 500 ms were collected. Fixation duration in the ﬁrst 500 ms
provides a valid measure of initial orienting, because only the stimulus
that captures orienting will be viewed within the ﬁrst 500 ms on most
trials (orienting to a peripheral stimulus is not completed until roughly
225 to 400 ms after stimulus onset, and initial gaze on a stimulus typically lasts at least 300 ms in a free viewing context; e.g., Garner et al.,
2006). Also, gaze duration in the initial 500 ms has been found to be
highly correlated with the direction of initial orienting (rs = .76 to .84,
ps b .001; Armstrong et al., 2010). When both event- and epochrelated orienting indicators were available (e.g., Rinck & Becker,
2006), the event-related variable was selected, because it provides a
more direct measure of initial orienting. When a study included two
presentation times and one presentation time was potentially too
brief to allow EMs (e.g., 175 ms; Stevens, Rist, & Gerlach, 2011), only
the longer presentation time was included. Orienting bias was examined for threatening, positive, and dysphoric stimuli.
The initial maintenance of attention on threat was assessed in free
viewing tasks of anxiety. Variables indicating the duration of initial
ﬁxation on threatening stimuli (event-related) were collected. Also,
variables indicating ﬁxation duration on threatening stimuli between
1000 and 2000 ms (epoch-related) were collected for studies that did
not report the event-related variable. These indicators have been found
to be moderately correlated (rs = .33 to .46, ps b .05; Armstrong et al.,
2010). Although the initial ﬁxation on a stimulus begins in the
0–1000 ms epoch, ﬁxation duration within this epoch is still largely
determined by the orienting of gaze, because after the initial orienting
and maintenance of gaze, there is little time left within the ﬁrst
1000 ms of the trial for viewing other stimuli. Accordingly, if one type

T. Armstrong, B.O. Olatunji / Clinical Psychology Review 32 (2012) 704–723

of stimulus disproportionately captures initial ﬁxations, this stimulus
type will necessarily be viewed more than other stimulus types during
the 0–1000 ms epoch.
For the event-related indicator of maintenance (i.e., initial ﬁxation
duration), within-subjects effects (initial maintenance on threatening
versus neutral stimuli) were compared between groups. Computing
the between groups effect without this within-subjects baseline
(i.e., initial maintenance on neutral stimuli) yielded equivalent
results. In contrast, epoch-related indicators of maintenance do not
offer such a relatively independent neutral baseline, because data
points for threatening and neutral variables are drawn from the
same trials; in many cases, the epoch-related indicators reported
were ratios of time spent viewing threatening relative to neutral
stimuli. Thus, in studies reporting epoch-related indicators of maintenance, a within-subjects effect was not computed before comparing
groups. Although some studies have examined maintenance of gaze
over a larger time scale (e.g., 0–60 s; Rinck & Becker, 2006), there
was not a sufﬁcient number of studies to allow meta-analysis of
maintenance of gaze beyond 2000 ms in anxiety disorders. However,
free viewing eye tracking studies of depression frequently employ
longer trials (10 to 30 s). For these studies, measures of total ﬁxation
duration on dysphoric, threatening, and pleasant stimuli were examined, in order to shed light on maintenance biases occurring over a
larger time scale in depression.
5.3.2. Visual search tasks
In visual search tasks, the vigilance hypothesis was assessed in
conditions with threatening targets and non-threatening distractors,
whereas the maintenance hypothesis was assessed in conditions
with threatening distractors and non-threatening targets. Average
ﬁxation time on distractors was the most frequently reported indicator of search efﬁciency and was used in both analyses. There was
some heterogeneity in how this indicator was reported, as some
studies reported average maintenance of gaze on all distractors of a
type, whereas some studies reported average maintenance of gaze on
individual distractors of a type (i.e., dividing total dwell on distractors
by the number of distractors ﬁxated). If neither variable was available,
latency to ﬁxating targets was used (k = 1; Miltner, Krieschel, Hecht,
Trippe, & Weiss, 2004). For the analysis of between-groups effects,
search conditions with non-threatening stimuli were used as a baseline
to control for performance differences between groups unrelated to
threat processing. This within-subjects effect was computed, and then
used as the basis for the between subjects effect. Computing the
between groups effect without this within-subjects baseline yielded
equivalent results. The within-groups effects alone were not interpretable, as the search conditions without threatening stimuli were not always matched for difﬁculty with the conditions containing distractors
(e.g., Miltner et al., 2004).
5.4. Statistical analysis
5.4.1. Calculation of effect sizes
Individual and combined effect sizes were computed using
Hedges's g (Hedges, 1981) with correction for small samples. This
index of effect size can be interpreted similarly to Cohen's d (0.2 =
small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large; Cohen, 1988). The direction of
effect size was coded such that increased allocation of attention (in
anxious or depressed individuals compared to controls) was reﬂected
in positive values, whereas decreased allocation of attention was
reﬂected in negative values. When means and standard deviations
were not available, statistical test values (i.e. F) were used to determine effect size (k = 3). When a result was reported as null without
additional information, but the direction of the effect could be inferred from ﬁgures (k = 3), a p value of .50 was assumed, in order to
ensure that the sample of outcomes was representative (Bar-Haim
et al., 2007; Cooper & Hedges, 1994). In studies that did not employ

711

high and low symptom groups (k = 2), correlations between gaze
biases and symptom measures were used to compute an effect size.
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, Version 2 (Biostat; Borenstein, Hedges,
Higgins, & Rothstein, 2005) was used to construct a database, to compute and weight effect sizes, and to conduct heterogeneity and moderator analyses. Forest plots were generated using the metafor package
for R statistical software (Viechtbauer, 2010).
5.4.2. Weighting of effect sizes, tests of heterogeneity, and moderator
analysis
Random effects models were used to calculate combined effect
sizes, because the studies in each analysis varied somewhat in terms
of participants and procedures. For each combined effect size, the
extent of heterogeneity was tested using the Q statistic (Hedges &
Olkin, 1985) and the I 2 statistic (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). A significant Q statistic suggests that variance in effect sizes around the combined effect size cannot be completely accounted for by sampling
error; the I 2 statistic estimates the percentage of this variance that
is due to between-studies variability (25% = low, 50% = medium,
and 75% = high heterogeneity; Higgins & Thompson, 2002). The Q
statistic is used to determine if moderator analysis is necessary, as
signiﬁcant heterogeneity suggests that there are moderators accounting for between-study variance in effect size. Categorical moderators
were tested using a mixed-effect meta-analytic categorical test (metaanalytic analysis of variance); continuous moderators were tested
using unrestricted maximum likelihood meta-regression (Hallion &
Ruscio, 2011). For the analysis of categorical moderators, levels of the
moderator had to have at least two studies to be included in the
analysis.
5.4.3. Publication bias
Estimates of combined effect sizes may be inﬂated by the suppression of null ﬁndings. This risk was reduced by searching for dissertation abstracts in addition to published articles, by requesting
unpublished studies from authors who frequently publish eye tracking research, and by requesting values in order to compute effect
sizes for variables that were not reported in articles. In addition, the
number of unreported null ﬁndings required to render an effect
non-signiﬁcant, the fail-safe N (FSN), was calculated for each signiﬁcant main effect (e.g., Bar-Haim et al., 2007).
6. Results
The present review integrates a total of 33 eye tracking experiments
with 1579 participants (anxious N = 563; non-anxious N = 532;
depressed N = 162; non-depressed N = 257; unselected: N =65).
Twenty-eight experiments utilized free viewing tasks (N =1337). Of
the experiments utilizing free viewing tasks, 20 examined anxiety
(Table 1) and 9 examined depression (Table 2; one study included
both anxious and depressed participants; Mogg et al., 2000).2 Five
experiments utilized visual search tasks and examined anxiety (N=
242; Table 3).
6.1. Vigilance hypothesis: free viewing tasks
In the analysis of orienting bias in anxious compared to nonanxious individuals, there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the effect
sizes for threatening stimuli Q (19) = 47.09, p b .001, I 2 = 59.65, and
marginal heterogeneity in the effect sizes for pleasant stimuli:
Q (10) = 17.66, p = .06, I 2 = 43.38. However, in the analysis of
2
Mogg et al.'s (2000) study included a GAD, MDD, and control group. For this study,
the same control group was used to determine the between-groups effect size of the
orienting bias for GAD versus controls and for MDD versus controls. Excluding this
study did not change the outcome of the analyses comparing depression and anxiety.
Thus, no attempt to correct for this small violation of independence was made.

orienting bias in depressed compared to non-depressed individuals,
there was not signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the effect sizes for threatening stimuli, Q (3) = .55, p = .95, I 2 = 0.0, or for pleasant stimuli,
Q (5) = 4.75, p = .55, I 2 = 0.0. As depicted in Fig. 2, anxious individuals initially oriented gaze towards threat more frequently than
non-anxious individuals, as revealed by a signiﬁcant combined effect
size for group differences in orienting bias for threat (k = 20; g = .47,
p b .001, CI = .25, .69; FSN: 203). Anxious individuals did not signiﬁcantly differ from non-anxious individuals in orienting towards pleasant stimuli (k = 11; g = .11, p = .38, CI = − .13, .35; Fig. 3).
Depressed individuals did not show an orienting bias towards
threat, compared to non-depressed individuals (k = 4; g = − .01,
p = .95 CI = − .30, .28). The difference in orienting towards threat in
anxious versus non-anxious individuals was signiﬁcantly different
compared to the difference in orienting towards threat in depressed
versus non-depressed individuals, Q (1) = 6.72, p = .01 (see Fig. 2).
Thus, it appears that an overt orienting bias towards threat characterizes anxiety, but not depression. Depressed individuals oriented towards pleasant stimuli less compared to non-depressed individuals
(k = 6; g = − .24, p b .05 CI = − .47, − .004; FSN = 6). This difference
in orienting towards pleasant stimuli in depressed versus nondepressed individuals was signiﬁcantly different compared to the difference in orienting towards pleasant stimuli in anxious versus
non-anxious individuals, Q = 4.10, p b .05 (see Fig. 3). Thus, it appears
that this modest reduction in orienting towards pleasant stimuli
is unique to depression. An additional analysis was conducted to
explore the possibility of an orienting bias toward dysphoric stimuli
in depressed versus non-depressed participants. Although one study
found an orienting bias towards dysphoric stimuli in depressed
versus never-depressed participants (Sears, Newman, Ference, &
Thomas, 2011), the combined effect size was not signiﬁcant (k = 6;
g = .18, p = .27, CI = − .18, .27; heterogeneity: Q (5) = 8.78, p = .12,
I 2 = 43.02).
Given the ﬁnding of signiﬁcant heterogeneity in studies of anxiety
but not depression, possible moderators of orienting towards threat
were only examined in studies of anxiety. Table 4 provides full results
for the moderator analysis. The only signiﬁcant moderator was
the operational deﬁnition of vigilance [event versus epoch-related
variable: Q (1) = 3.54, p = .05]. The combined effect size was larger

in studies reporting an event-related orienting variable (k = 16, g =
.58, CI = .33, .83, p b .001) compared to studies only reporting an
epoch-related orienting variable (k = 4, g = .12, CI= −.27, .51, p = .19).

6.2. Maintenance hypothesis: free viewing tasks
There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the effect size for initial
maintenance of gaze on threat in anxious compared to non-anxious
individuals, Q (15) = 58.08, p b .001, I 2 = 74.17. Anxious individuals
did not differ overall in their initial maintenance of gaze on threat
compared to non-anxious individuals (k = 16; g = − .17, p = .26,
CI = − .47, .13; Fig. 4). To account for the heterogeneity in initial
maintenance of gaze on threat in anxiety, possible moderators were
examined. Table 5 provides full results of the moderator analysis
described below. Type of anxiety disorder signiﬁcantly moderated
group differences in initial maintenance of gaze on threat, Q (4) =
24.13, p b .001. Studies of spider phobia found signiﬁcantly decreased
maintenance of gaze on threat in anxious relative to non-anxious participants (k = 3; g = −1.02, p b .001, CI = − 1.41, − .64; Q (2) = .05,
p = .79, I 2 = 0.0). Studies of generalized/trait anxiety found a similar
yet marginally signiﬁcant effect (k = 2; g = − .25, p b .10, CI = − .54,
.04). Studies of contamination-based OCD (k = 2; g = − .24, p = .60,
CI = − 1.1, .66; Q (4) = 4.54, p b .05, I 2 = 77.98) and social anxiety
(k = 7; g = .05, p = .83, CI = − .42, .53; Q (4) = 23.45, p b .001, I 2 =
74.41) were highly heterogeneous and did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant combined effects related to the initial maintenance of gaze. Studies of
PTSD found marginally signiﬁcant increased maintenance of gaze in
anxious relative to non-anxious participants (k = 2; g = .60, p = .05,
CI = .01, − 1.21; Q (1) = .10, p = .76, I 2 = 0.0). 3
3
Initial maintenance of gaze on threatening stimuli in anxious versus non-anxious
participants was marginally moderated by the type of threatening stimulus employed
(face versus picture), Q (1) = 3.39, p b .06. However, this ﬁnding appeared to be an artifact of the exclusive use of pictures in studies of spider phobia (k = 3), in which a
strong bias away from threat was found. When the analysis was repeated with studies
of spider phobia removed, the moderation by stimulus type was no longer signiﬁcant,
Q (1) = .34, p = .56, and there was no longer a signiﬁcant combined effect in the
remaining studies that used threatening pictures, k = 3; g = −.12, p = .72, CI = −.78,
.54; Q (8) = 6.50, p b .05, I2 = 69.24.

compared to non-anxious individuals, Q (4) = 8.28, p = .08, I 2 =
51.66. Anxious individuals maintained attention longer on threatening distractors compared to non-anxious individuals (k = 5; g = .54,
p b .01, CI = .17, .92; FSN = 26). Due to the small number of studies,
no moderation analyses were conducted for visual search tasks.
Meta-analytic ﬁndings for visual search tasks are displayed in Fig. 6.

6.3. Extended maintenance of gaze in depression
There was not signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the extended maintenance of gaze on threatening, Q (5) = 1.9, p = .86, I 2 = 0.0, or pleasant
stimuli, Q (5) = .66, p = .97, I 2 = 0.0; however, there was marginally
signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the extended maintenance of gaze on
dysphoric stimuli, Q (5) = 9.77, p = .08 I 2 = 48.82. As depicted in
Fig. 5, depressed individuals did not maintain gaze on threatening
stimuli differently than non-depressed individuals during extended
viewing (k = 6; g = .08, p = .50, CI = − .15, .31). However, depressed
individuals maintained gaze on dysphoric stimuli longer than nondepressed individuals (k = 6; g = .46, p b .01, CI = .12, .80; FSN = 28).
In addition, depressed individuals maintained gaze on positive
stimuli less than non-depressed individuals (k = 6; g = −.80, p b .001,
CI= −1.04, −.56; FSN= 84). Due to the moderate amount of heterogeneity in the extended maintenance bias for dysphoric stimuli, type
of depressed group (clinical or analogue) was examined as a possible
moderator. Studies of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for
major depressive disorder found a more robust maintenance bias for
dysphoric stimuli in depression (k = 2; g = 1.07, p b .01, CI= .36,
1.80), compared to studies of individuals meeting a cut-off score for a
symptom measure (k = 4; g = .26, p b .06, CI= −.01, .53), Q (1) =
4.40, p b .05.

7. Discussion
The present review provides the ﬁrst meta-analysis of EM biases
for emotional stimuli in affective disorders. In studies of anxiety, the
vigilance hypothesis was supported in both free viewing and visual
search tasks: anxious individuals were characterized by an orienting
bias towards threat during free viewing and facilitated detection of
threat during visual search, compared to non-anxious individuals.
An orienting bias for threat in free viewing did not characterize depressed individuals compared to non-depressed individuals, suggesting
that vigilance for threat is speciﬁc to anxiety (Mogg & Bradley, 2005). In
contrast, evidence for the maintenance hypothesis was inconsistent. In
free viewing tasks, increased initial maintenance of gaze on threat was
found only in studies of PTSD. Overall, anxious participants showed a
marginal tendency to avoid maintaining gaze on threat compared to
non-anxious individuals and this effect was particularly pronounced
in spider phobia. However, in visual search tasks, anxious participants
did show a tendency to maintain gaze longer on threatening distractors
compared to non-anxious participants. Interestingly, this effect was
based mostly on studies of spider phobic individuals, who showed the
strongest tendency to avoid maintaining gaze on threat in free viewing
tasks.
The present meta-analysis also has important implications for
theoretical accounts of attention bias in depression. Depressed
individuals showed a blunted orienting response to pleasant stimuli
compared to non-depressed individuals, a bias not seen in anxious

6.4. Visual search tasks
There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the effect size for facilitated
detection of threatening targets in anxious compared to non-anxious
individuals, Q (3) = 10.89, p b .02, I 2 = 72.46. Anxious individuals
ﬁxated threatening targets faster, compared to non-anxious individuals (k = 4; g = − .59, p b .04, CI = − 1.15, −.04; FSN = 17). There
was marginally signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the effect size for increased maintenance of gaze on threatening distractors in anxious

individuals compared to non-anxious individuals. An ‘anhedonic bias’
was also observed in the extended maintenance of gaze, where
depressed individuals again showed reduced attention to pleasant
stimuli, compared to non-depressed individuals. Depressed individuals
also showed increased maintenance of gaze on dysphoric stimuli, but
not on threatening stimuli, compared to non-depressed individuals.
7.1. Implications for the vigilance hypothesis
The most frequently observed effect in eye tracking studies of
anxiety disorders is a spatial orienting bias towards threat in anxious
versus non-anxious individuals. The medium effect size of this bias
(g = .47) is consistent with the effect size observed for anxious versus
non-anxious individuals in Bar-Haim et al.'s (2007) review of RT measures of attentional bias for threat (d = .41). This bias appears to be
speciﬁc to threatening stimuli, as anxious individuals did not show
an orienting bias towards positive stimuli compared to non-anxious
individuals, as would be predicted under the emotionality hypothesis
(Calvo & Avero, 2005). The orienting bias towards threat in anxiety
was heterogeneous in nature, as would be expected given the methodological variance in the free viewing studies reviewed. However,
the moderator analysis provided limited insight into this variance.
The only factor that appeared to moderate the orienting bias towards
threat was its operational deﬁnition. Studies reporting only an
epoch-related indicator (i.e., ﬁxation duration in initial 500 ms) had

difﬁculty observing the bias, compared to studies using an eventrelated indicator (i.e., proportion of initial ﬁxations captured). Epochrelated indicators may be too indirect to reliably capture the orienting
of gaze, despite two studies ﬁnding convergence between event- and
epoch-related measures of orienting (Armstrong et al., 2010; Rinck &
Becker, 2006).
The robust orienting bias for threat observed in free viewing studies
of anxiety is consistent with models of attentional bias emphasizing
facilitated detection of threat through exogenous shifts of attention.
The studies reviewed herein cannot rule out the possibility that
orienting to threat was endogenous in anxious individuals (see Calvo
& Lang, 2005); this would require documenting the bias in the presence
of voluntary efforts to inhibit orienting towards threat. However, previous research suggests that orienting to an emotional image in this task
context is largely unaffected by contrary instructions to look at an
accompanying neutral image (Nummenmaa et al., 2006). Further, a
study that measured EMs during an emotional spatial cueing task
found that anxious individuals involuntarily oriented gaze to threat
cues more frequently than non-anxious individuals, despite instructions not to orient gaze to the cues (i.e., instructions to maintain central
ﬁxation; Broomﬁeld & Turpin, 2005).
However, this overt orienting bias towards threat may not reﬂect
purely exogenous attentional capture, which would begin preattentively, at the earliest stages of sensory processing (Corbetta &
Shulman, 2002). The average latency of initial ﬁxations on threat in

anxious individuals ranged from roughly 225 to 400 ms (Armstrong et al.,
2010; Garner et al., 2006; Mogg et al., 2000). As Nummenmaa et al.
(2006) note, reﬂexive saccades typical of purely exogenous capture

(e.g., resulting from the sudden onset of a stimulus with a sharply
contrasting basic feature) have a latency of 150 to 175 ms (Rayner,
1998). The saccade latencies observed in studies of anxiety suggest a
brief window of parafoveal processing in which some semantic content
could be derived through covert attention. Such processing has been
shown to be capable of guiding EMs on the basis of speciﬁc emotional
content that goes beyond mere valence (i.e., positive versus negative;
Calvo & Nummenmaa, 2007). This is consistent with ﬁndings that anxious
individuals orient gaze speciﬁcally to symptom-related threat as opposed
to more generally threatening stimuli (e.g., Armstrong, Sarawgi, &
Olatunji, 2012).
The analysis of visual search also suggested that overt orienting to
threat in anxiety differs from more prototypical cases of exogenous
attentional capture. In the visual search studies reviewed herein,
there was no report of facilitated detection of threat targets in the
initial ﬁxation of a trial. Thus, the increased perceptual load and/or
the greater potential eccentricity of stimuli associated with visual
search arrays appeared to eliminate the initial orienting bias that
could be observed in smaller arrays associated with free viewing
tasks. Although anxious individuals did not immediately orient to
threatening visual search targets, they did ﬁxate on these targets
sooner than non-anxious individuals. Such facilitated overt threat
detection in anxiety may still involve an exogenous orienting bias,
albeit one that is capacity-limited, and only effective once gaze is
directed to a nearby distracter, bringing the threatening stimulus
within a range of eccentricity from which it can attract attention
under perceptual load.
However, the present ﬁndings leave open the possibility that
facilitated threat detection in anxiety also involves more rapid

disengagement from neutral stimuli, a process that may rely on
endogenous attentional control. Whereas an exogenous orienting
bias for threatening targets would result in fewer ﬁxations on neutral
distractors, facilitated detection of threatening targets could also be
achieved through shorter ﬁxations on neutral distractors (c.f. Rinck
& Becker, 2006). One component of hypervigilance for threat in anxiety may be the ability to rapidly disengage from neutral stimuli
during the search for threat, a process that would draw on the endogenous, top-down control of attention. Becker (2009), for example,
found more rapid disengagement from neutral stimuli following the
presentation of a threatening stimulus in an unselected sample. In
anxious individuals, this so-called ‘panic search’ may be triggered
when individuals anticipate the presence of threat. Unfortunately,
the studies reviewed did not report the number and duration of ﬁxations on distractors with enough consistency to fully address this
question.

Support for the maintenance hypothesis was far less consistent
than support for the vigilance hypothesis. Contrary to the maintenance hypothesis, anxious individuals overall did not show increased
initial maintenance of gaze on threat compared to non-anxious individuals in free viewing tasks. However, an initial maintenance bias
for threat was found in PTSD during free viewing. This was in sharp

contrast to studies of spider phobia, which found a strong tendency
to avoid initially maintaining gaze on threat in anxious versus
non-anxious individuals. Gaze avoidance may be particularly strong
in spider phobia because spider fearful individuals ﬁnd spiders disgusting (e.g., Mulkens, de Jong, & Merckelbach, 1996), and may be
revolted by the perceptual features of spiders (Royzman & Sabini,
2001). Also, differences in the nature of threat encountered in PTSD
and spider phobia may help explain this discrepancy. Threats related
to traumatic events (combat: Kimble et al., 2010; physical assault:
Felmingham et al., 2011) present greater urgency and danger compared to spiders, and thus may be more difﬁcult to ignore. Whereas
spider fearful individuals may learn to cope with the presence of spiders by looking elsewhere, individuals with PTSD may perceive the
need to maintain attention on trauma cues to avoid immediate harm.
The tendency to avoid maintaining gaze on spiders in spider phobia
may reverse when the urgency of threat increases. For example,
Lange, Tierney, Reinhardt-Rutland, and Vivekananda-Schmidt (2004)
presented a live spider to individuals high and low in spider fear. The
spider was presented on either side of a television presenting a program
that participants were instructed to watch carefully. Trials lasted 3 min,
and increased maintenance of gaze on the spider, as well as the room's
exit, was found in individuals high versus low in spider fear. The
sustained maintenance of gaze on real spiders found by Lange et al.
(2004) contrasts with the sustained avoidance of gaze on mere images
of spiders found over 3 s (Hermans, Vansteenwegen, & Eelen, 1999;
Rinck & Becker, 2006), 9 s (Pﬂugshaupt et al., 2007) and 60 s (Rinck &

718

Becker, 2006) trials. One might conclude that Lange et al.'s ﬁndings cast
doubt on the clinical signiﬁcance of attentional avoidance of threatening images, because the phenomenon may be limited to encounters
with mere representations of threat. However, an alternative explanation is that anxious individuals decide whether or not to sustain attention on threat according to a cost–beneﬁt analysis. Threatening stimuli,
as danger cues, likely occur on a continuum of urgency. Anxious individuals may risk ignoring low urgency danger cues (e.g., an image of a
spider) in exchange for the negative reinforcement of anxiety reduction
(Mogg & Bradley, 1998). However, these individuals may feel compelled to continue monitoring more urgent danger cues (e.g., a live
tarantula in a nearby box) at the cost of increased anxiety. Under this
scenario, attentional avoidance could still contribute to anxiety disorders by preventing reappraisal and fear extinction of less urgent danger
cues (e.g. an innocuous spider in one's bedroom), which may be
encountered more frequently and thus cause greater impairment.
Although a maintenance bias on threat in anxiety was not consistently observed during free viewing, it was observed for threatening
distractors during visual search for non-threatening targets. Compared to non-anxious individuals, anxious individuals were slower
in locating neutral targets accompanied by a threatening distractor.
Although this ﬁnding could reﬂect more frequent shifting of gaze to
threatening distractors (Miltner et al., 2004), rather than difﬁculty
disengaging gaze from these distractors (Rinck & Becker, 2006),
Gerdes, Alpers, and Pauli (2008) found that spider phobics were
slower to detect a neutral target due to longer ﬁxations rather than
more frequent ﬁxations on a spider distractor, suggesting difﬁculty
disengaging attention from threat. Interestingly, the spider phobics
in Gerdes et al.'s (2008) study showed increased ﬁxations to all
distractor types, compared to controls. This ﬁnding is consistent
with RT research suggesting that when spider phobics anticipate the
possibility of a spider distractor, the stimulus-driven system becomes
dominant, leading to increased exogenous shifting to all distractors
(Devue, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2011). Inhibitory control deﬁcits
related to anxiety (Eysenck et al., 2007) may be more threat-speciﬁc
in the engagement of attention compared to the shifting of attention
because more information is available once a stimulus is engaged,
reducing ‘false alarms.’
The present meta-analytic ﬁndings suggest that difﬁculty disengaging
attention from threat in anxiety may only be observed in certain viewing
contexts. The critical contextual factor may be whether or not participants are explicitly required to disengage attention from threat. When
threatening stimuli are presented as distracters during visual search, participants must disengage from these stimuli in order to pursue the neutral
target. In this context, there is task incentive to disengage attention from
threat that applies evenly to all participants. In a free viewing task, there
is no task incentive to disengage attention from threat, yet there may be
an affective incentive, as threat stimuli arouse anxiety or fear. Given
that anxious individuals rate threatening stimuli as more unpleasant
(e.g., Rinck & Becker, 2006), and have been observed to voluntarily terminate exposure to threatening images sooner compared to non-anxious
individuals (Tolin, Lohr, Lee, & Sawchuk, 1999), it follows that anxious individuals have a greater affective incentive to disengage attention from
threat, and may exert more effort towards this end. This additional effort
may compensate for, and thus conceal, difﬁculty disengaging attention
from threat in anxious individuals (Ansari & Derakshan, 2011b), reducing
the sensitivity of free viewing tasks in detecting this bias. This explanation
is in line with the distinction between “effectiveness” and “efﬁciency”
posited by ACT (Eysenck et al., 2007). As Berggren and Derakshan (in
press) explain, anxious individuals may be able to disengage attention
as effectively as non-anxious individuals in certain contexts, but such
disengagement is less efﬁcient, as anxious individuals apply more effort
in order to compensate for attentional control deﬁcits. This distinction
may be best observed in the anti-saccade task. Derakshan, Ansari,
Shoker, Hansard, and Eysenck (2009) found that anxious individuals
were able to execute saccades away from a threatening face as effectively

as non-anxious individuals (i.e., with similar error rates); however, their
correct saccades away from threatening faces had longer latencies,
suggesting less efﬁciency disengaging covert attention from threatening
faces in order to execute a saccade to an opposite location.
7.3. Gaze biases in anxiety compared to depression
The present meta-analysis has several implications for conceptualizing the differences between attentional biases in anxiety and
depression. Whereas a robust orienting bias towards threat was
found in anxiety, no orienting bias towards threat was observed in
depression. This ﬁnding is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of
RT studies of attentional bias in depression, which found no bias for
threatening stimuli in depressed compared to non-depressed individuals (Peckham et al., 2010; see also Mogg & Bradley, 2005). Also,
whereas anxious individuals showed a slight increase in orienting to
positive stimuli compared to non-anxious individuals, depressed
individuals showed a tendency to orient gaze less to positive stimuli,
compared to non-depressed individuals. This ﬁnding is also consistent with Peckham et al.'s (2010) recent review, which found reduced
initial attention allocation to positive stimuli in depressed individuals
(c.f., Derakshan, Salt, et al., 2009). This convergent evidence from EM
and RT measures suggests that anxiety and depression have distinct
effects on the exogenous capture of attention. Anxiety appears to
increase the exogenous system's sensitivity to threatening stimuli,
whereas depression appears to decrease the system's sensitivity to
positive stimuli.
In tripartite structural theories of internalizing disorders (e.g., Clark
& Watson, 1991), the development of anxiety and depression can be
understood in terms of a general factor (e.g., negative affect or neuroticism) that confers risk for both disorders, as well as disorder-speciﬁc
factors, such as anxious arousal or low positive affect, which speciﬁcally
confer risk for anxiety or depression, respectively (Oehlberg, Revelle, &
Mineka, in press). The presence of an orienting bias towards threat in
anxiety, but not depression, suggests that vigilance for threat is related
to an anxiety speciﬁc factor, as opposed to a general factor of internalizing. Similarly, the presence of reduced orienting towards positive stimuli in depression, but not anxiety, suggests that an anhedonic bias is
related to a depression-speciﬁc factor, as opposed to a more general
risk factor for internalizing disorders, such as negative affect. The
depression-speciﬁc factor most commonly cited is low positive affect
(e.g., Clark & Watson, 1991), which involves difﬁculty experiencing
pleasure and reduced sensitivity to rewards. Low positive affect may
cause the exogenous system to be insensitive to reward cues, leading
to a deﬁcit in orienting towards positive stimuli.
The present study could not determine if extended viewing biases
related to positive stimuli were unique to depression; however, it
seems likely that the strong anhedonic bias in extended viewing in
depression is also related to low positive affect. Depressed individuals
may voluntarily maintain gaze less on positive stimuli because they
are less sensitive to the intrinsic pleasantness of the stimuli, reducing
their incentive to maintain gaze. This is consistent with ERP research
suggesting that happy faces are less salient and receive less attention
in depressed individuals, as revealed by the P300, an early component
reﬂecting endogenous processing (Cavanagh & Geisler, 2006). ERP
research on working memory in depression may also provide insight
into decreased extended maintenance of gaze on positive stimuli.
Deldin, Deveney, Kim, Casas, and Best (2001) found that individuals
with major depressive disorder show a reduced slow wave (SW)
component while maintaining positive adjectives in working memory,
compared to controls. The SW component may reﬂect elaborative processing and other working memory processes between 1 and 5 s after
stimulus onset. Behavioral research has also found that depression is
characterized by decreased maintenance of positive stimuli in working
memory relative to controls (Levens & Gotlib, 2010). Working memory
content has been found to guide selective attention (e.g., Downing,

T. Armstrong, B.O. Olatunji / Clinical Psychology Review 32 (2012) 704–723

2000), suggesting a possible top-down process in depression in which
decreased maintenance of positive stimuli in working memory leads
to reduced maintenance of gaze on pleasant stimuli. Reduced attention
to positive stimuli could have important clinical implications. Failing to
notice or elaborate on positive events could have proximal effects on
state affect, depriving depressed individuals of potential pleasure. In
addition, these biases could have more distal effects on cognitive schemata. For example, Ellis, Beevers, and Wells (2011) found that reduced
gaze towards positive stimuli in depression led to reduced memory for
positive stimuli. Over time, failing to attend to and remember positive
stimuli could cause depressed individuals to view the world as less
abundant with rewards (Gotlib & McCann, 1984; Shane & Peterson,
2007).
Depressed individuals also showed a tendency to maintain gaze
on dysphoric stimuli longer than non-depressed individuals during
extended viewing (10 to 30 s), and this bias was most pronounced
in depressed individuals meeting full diagnostic criteria for major
depressive disorder. This ﬁnding has generally been interpreted as
evidence of increased elaborative processing of dysphoric content in
depression (Eizenman et al., 2003; Kellough, Beevers, Ellis, & Wells,
2008; Leyman, De Raedt, Vaeyens, & Phillipaerts, 2011). Increased
retention of dysphoric content in working memory may drive the
extended maintenance of attention on dysphoric stimuli, through
the same top down inﬂuence of working memory on attention that
may underlie the lack of dwell on positive stimuli in depression.
Depressed individuals exhibit difﬁculty removing negative content
from working memory (Levens & Gotlib, 2010), and this phenomenon has been observed over a 10 s time window (Joormann &
Gotlib, 2008) similar to the time window of extended viewing in
many of the studies of depression reviewed herein. If an attentional
bias towards dysphoric content in depression indeed requires the
maintenance of negative content in working memory, it could explain
why an initial orienting bias towards dysphoric content in depression
was not found, as such a bias would operate before negative content
begins to “stick” in working memory. On this account, the extended
maintenance bias for dysphoric stimuli in depression would relate
to a deﬁcit in the updating mechanism of attentional control, which
manages the content of working memory (Eysenck et al., 2007).
This may contrast with the initial maintenance bias in anxiety,
which appears to relate to a deﬁcit in the inhibition function, which
overrides stimulus-driven effects in attention allocation.
7.4. Clinical implications: eye tracking and attention modiﬁcation
procedures
Recently there have been a number of studies demonstrating that
training attention away from threat leads to functional improvement
in anxiety (Hallion & Ruscio, 2011), and one study suggests an analogous effect related to dysphoric stimuli in depression (Wells &
Beevers, 2010). The present ﬁndings may have important implications for attention-based treatment of anxiety. Concerns have been
raised about training attention away from threat in anxiety, as it
could engender attentional avoidance of threat, which is believed to
impair emotional processing and maintain anxiety (Koster, Baert,
Bockstaele, & De Raedt, 2010). Indeed, Koster et al. (2010) found
that training attention away from threat did not affect vigilance for
threat in the modiﬁed dot probe (100 ms SOA); however, it did lead
to later avoidance of threat (1500 ms SOA), a bias similar to that
observed in spider phobia in the present meta-analysis. The congruence between attention training away from threat and attentional
avoidance in spider phobia may explain why several studies have
failed to observe beneﬁcial effects of attention training in this disorder (Harris & Menzies, 1998; Reese, McNally, Najmi, & Amir, 2010;
Van Bockstaele et al., 2011). It is possible that attention training towards threat (Klumpp & Amir, 2010) would be more useful in
treating spider phobia and perhaps other speciﬁc phobias as well.

719

The present ﬁndings may also have implications for training attention in depression. The ﬁnding of an attentional bias in the extended
maintenance of gaze supports the use of longer stimulus presentations in the training of attention in depression. Indeed, training attention over longer viewing windows (e.g., 3 s, 4.5 s; Wells & Beevers,
2010) appears to be more effective at modifying attentional bias in
depression and reducing symptoms of depression, compared to training over a shorter viewing period (1.5 s; Baert, De Raedt, Schacht, &
Koster, 2010). Further, the ﬁnding of decreased attention to positive
stimuli in depression suggests that researchers should consider training attention toward positive stimuli in depressed individuals (Baert
et al., 2010), in addition to training attention away from negative
stimuli (Wells & Beevers, 2010). A positivity bias appears to promote
resilience (see Wadlinger & Isaacowitz, 2011), and initial evidence
suggests that biases for positive stimuli can be induced through training and may have beneﬁcial effects (Wadlinger & Isaacowitz, 2008).
Lastly, eye tracking could help determine the potential role of
overt attention in attention training. Currently, it is unclear to what
extent individuals make EMs during attention training. In the
unweighted version of the dot probe (which is used as a control condition in training studies), EMs to either cue have been found to occur
on 30% of trials overall; some individuals make EMs on more than half
of trials, whereas others hardly make any EMs (Bradley, Mogg, &
Millar, 2000). The efﬁcacy of training may be increased by requiring
EMs (through instructions or greater stimulus eccentricity). Given
that EMs are the primary means of visual selection in daily life, and
that covert attentional shifts do not assure EMs, it is possible that
training effects would generalize more to everyday contexts if EMs
were required. Also, the additional resources required to make an
EM may increase the ‘resistance’ of the exercise, increasing the
strength of attentional control gained through training.
7.5. Limitations
7.5.1. Eye tracking and covert attention
Although eye tracking addresses many of the shortcomings of RT
measures in the study of attentional biases, the measurement of
EMs has limitations of its own. Most notably, attentional resources
may be allocated covertly, in the absence of saccadic EMs registered
by eye tracking. This limitation may have the greatest implications
for tests of the maintenance hypothesis. As Garner et al. (2006)
note, eye tracking experiments may fail to observe increased maintenance of attention on threatening stimuli because the phenomenon
could occur covertly, prior to initial ﬁxation. These authors cite Fox
et al.'s (2001) spatial cueing study, which found greater difﬁculty
disengaging covert attention from incongruent threat cues presented
at 100 ms or 250 ms SOAs in anxious individuals compared to controls. Similarly, Fox, Derakshan, and Shoker (2008) found that anxious individuals compared to controls showed an enhanced early
N2pc ERP in response to threatening stimuli, a component that
reveals covert attention-related activity in the parietal cortex occurring 170–220 ms after stimulus onset. In free viewing tasks, EMs to
threatening stimuli were not completed until roughly 225 ms to
400 ms after stimulus onset (Armstrong et al., 2010; Garner et al.,
2006; Mogg et al., 2000), suggesting that increased maintenance of
visual attention on threat could occur prior to one's initial ﬁxation
on threat. Thus, free viewing studies may fail to observe increased
maintenance of attention on threat because the phenomenon occurs
early in the covert deployment of attention, and thus eludes EM
data. However, if the maintenance bias in anxiety were limited to
covert attention in the ﬁrst 250 ms of stimulus processing, it would
call into question the functional signiﬁcance of the bias.
7.5.2. Limitations of the eye tracking literature
Eye tracking research in affective disorders has been conducted for
just over a decade and did not gain momentum until recent years. As

720

T. Armstrong, B.O. Olatunji / Clinical Psychology Review 32 (2012) 704–723

a result, some of the analyses in the present study were based on a
small number of studies and ﬁndings should be interpreted with
appropriate caution. Although the analyses of initial orienting towards threat (k = 20) and maintenance of attention on threat
(k = 16) in anxiety drew on a moderate number of studies, there
were far fewer studies in the analysis of orienting towards threatening
(k =4) and positive stimuli in depression (k = 6), as well as in the analysis of extended maintenance of gaze in depression (k = 6). However,
effect sizes were mostly consistent across studies of depression, and
the combined effects were largely consistent with RT research on attentional biases in depression (Peckham et al., 2010). There were also a
small number of studies in the analysis of visual search tasks (k = 5),
and these studies consisted almost entirely of studies of spider phobias
(k =4), raising concern about the generalizability of the present ﬁndings to other anxiety disorders.
Another limitation of extant research is that few studies examined
attention to threat beyond three seconds of exposure, and many studies employed even shorter trials. Thus, a more thorough investigation
of the time course of attentional bias for threat—one of the chief
promises of eye tracking methodology—could not be fully realized
in the present analysis. However, from the few studies that did
employ longer trials, it appears that trends present in the initial maintenance of attention continue over a larger time scale. For example,
the present ﬁnding of decreased maintenance of gaze on threat in
spider phobia was found to hold throughout the course of longer trials
(9 s: Pﬂugshaupt et al., 2007; 60 s: Rinck & Becker, 2006). Also, the
present ﬁnding of increased initial maintenance of gaze on threat in
PTSD was found to continue over 10 s trials (Kimble et al., 2010).

all participants are explicitly required to disengage attention from
threat. In addition to visual search tasks, endogenous cueing paradigms provide another means of requiring disengagement from
threat (e.g., Sears, Thomas, LeHuquet, & Johnson, 2010). An endogenous cueing test of the maintenance bias could present disorderrelevant stimuli centrally, and then present a tone at random SOAs
that required shifting attention to a peripheral location. Saccade
latencies following the tone would provide a direct indicator of
delayed disengagement. A somewhat similar design was employed
by Sears et al. (2010) in their study of attentional biases for dysphoric
stimuli in depression. In their task, a single stimulus appeared in one
of four locations, and on 25% of trials, a central arrow cue directed
attention toward a corner of the screen. Sears et al. (2010) found
that depressed individuals were slower initiating saccades away
from dysphoric images, but not other image types (i.e., threatening,
pleasant, neutral) compared to non-depressed individuals, a maintenance bias that was not revealed in a free viewing condition of their
study. Testing of the maintenance hypothesis would also beneﬁt
from the inclusion of an independent assessment of endogenous
attentional control, such that the role of attentional control deﬁcits
could be parsed from the role of bottom-up signal enhancement for
threatening stimuli. The antisaccade task, which has been shown to reveal general inhibitory deﬁcits related to anxiety (Ansari & Derakshan,
2011a) and depression (De Lissnyder et al., 2011), would be ideal for
these purposes. The antisaccade task can also be modiﬁed to include
emotional stimuli, in order to reveal inhibitory deﬁcits speciﬁc to affective contents in anxiety (Derakshan, Ansari, et al., 2009) and depression
(Derakshan, Salt, et al., 2009).

7.6. Future directions

7.6.3. Reﬁning assessment of attentional avoidance
In the present review, the majority of studies examining attentional avoidance measured ﬁxation duration on stimuli as a function
of time. However, attentional avoidance may also be seen in the distance between a ﬁxation point and the nearest threatening stimulus.
Pﬂugshaupt et al. (2005) embedded spiders in images of household
scenes and found evidence of avoidance in the distance between a
ﬁxation's coordinates and the nearest spider; further, they examined
this relationship as a function of the ordinal number of the ﬁxation,
which provided a novel window into the vigilant-avoidant style of
attention in anxiety (Mogg & Bradley, 1998). One advantage of
embedding threatening stimuli in naturalistic scenes is the variety
of locations that can be ﬁxated, which create a spectrum of distance
from threat. Embedding threatening stimuli in natural scenes also
provides greater insight into how attentional biases operate in “real
life” environments, insight which may be unique to eye tracking
methodology.

7.6.1. Reﬁning the vigilance hypothesis
The vigilance hypothesis holds that anxious individuals detect
threat more readily than non-anxious individuals. The present review
ﬁrmly established an overt orienting bias as one mechanism of vigilance for threat in anxiety. However, the extant literature leaves
much to be learned about facilitated threat detection. For example,
the boundary conditions of increased orienting to threat in anxiety
have not been clearly outlined. Basic research suggests that the ability
of threatening stimuli to capture gaze is affected by how many competing stimuli are present (perceptual load; Yates, Ashwin, & Fox, 2010)
and how far into the periphery stimuli are presented (eccentricity;
Calvo, Nummenmaa, & Hyönä, 2008). In the analysis of vigilance for
threat in visual search tasks, the absence of an initial orienting bias for
threat in anxiety suggests that such boundary conditions are present,
and likely depend on one of these factors or their interaction (Acunzo
& Henderson, 2011). Future eye tracking research that systematically
varies these parameters over a wide range of values would help delineate these boundary conditions with more precision. Such ﬁndings
could inform theoretical models of attentional bias and provide a better
sense of the prevalence of this phenomenon in the lives of anxious individuals. Another important question regarding orienting towards threat
in anxiety is its relation to endogenous attentional control (Derryberry
& Reed, 2002). In free viewing tasks, participants are not required to resist orienting to threat, and thus it is unclear to what extent the bias is
moderated by deﬁcits in endogenous attentional control, which have
consistently been found in anxiety disorders (e.g., Armstrong et al.,
2011). The free viewing paradigms reviewed in the present study
could be modiﬁed with instructions to make saccades in a speciﬁed direction (Nummenmaa, Hyönä, & Calvo, 2009) or towards a speciﬁed
stimulus (Nummenmaa et al., 2006), requiring participants not to orient gaze towards threat.
7.6.2. Reﬁning the maintenance hypothesis
The present meta-analytic ﬁndings suggest that increased maintenance of gaze on threat in anxiety is best observed in a task in which

7.6.4. Moving beyond the vigilance and maintenance hypotheses
A large majority of the eye tracking studies reviewed herein were
framed as tests of the vigilance and maintenance hypotheses. These
purportedly competing hypotheses have been useful for advancing
research on attentional biases in anxiety disorders, in that both offer
mutually exclusive predictions that are easily testable. Further, the
vigilance and maintenance hypothesis are both well-grounded in
theory and have been linked to plausible neural substrates (Cisler &
Koster, 2010). However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive
(Weierich et al., 2008). Further, the present analysis revealed that the
expression of each bias is context dependent, such that a paradigm
will likely favor one hypothesis over the other. The value of pitting
these hypotheses against each other may therefore be questionable,
particularly when a study employs only one type of task. A more fruitful approach would involve testing the conditions under which either
hypothesis holds. Although this approach has not been applied to
anxiety disorders, Sears et al.'s (2010) eye tracking study of depression, which included an effortful disengagement condition in addition
to a free viewing condition, provides an illustrative example.

In addition, an over-reliance on broad constructs, such as vigilance, maintenance, or avoidance in the interpretation of EM data
has the potential to obscure underlying attentional mechanisms. As
noted in the present review, facilitated detection of threat (i.e., vigilance) could derive from an orienting bias for threat or from rapid
disengagement from neutral distractors; increased attention on dysphoric stimuli (i.e., maintenance) could occur through voluntary
or involuntary attentional engagement; and attentional avoidance
could be achieved by rapid disengagement from threat or by maintenance of gaze at a distant location. Theoretical accounts of attentional
bias would beneﬁt from a shift in emphasis from attentional outcomes (e.g., facilitated detection of threat) to the processes that
determine these outcomes. An over-reliance on broad attentional
constructs can also stiﬂe the discovery and exploration of novel
gaze biases. For example, there appear to be gaze biases related to
the encoding of information that may have clinical signiﬁcance
through their impact on memory. Hyperscanning of threat (greater
distance between ﬁxations) has been found in social anxiety disorder
for threatening faces (Horley, Williams, Gonsalvez, & Gordon, 2003;
Horley, Williams, Gonsalvez, & Gordon, 2004), and in dysphoria, this
pattern of attention for angry faces has been found to increase memory bias for angry faces (Wells, Beevers, Robison, & Ellis, 2010).
Likewise, shorter ﬁxations on threat, but not increased overall dwell
time, has been found in contamination fear (Armstrong et al., 2012),
and this fragmented viewing style was found to predict vulnerability
to PTSD in response to combat stress (Beevers, Lee, Wells, Ellis, &
Telch, 2011). Whereas hyperscanning may increase retention of
threat in memory, fragmented viewing may interfere with habituation to threat. Although these conclusions are highly tentative, such
ﬁndings highlight the potential for EMs to reveal pathways to abnormal emotional processing that lie beyond the scope of extant
constructs.
